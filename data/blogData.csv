CNET,How to watch the Razer Phone 2 event,10/09/18,https://www.cnet.com/news/razer-phone-2-event-livestream-start-time-what-to-expect/," On Wednesday in Los Angeles, Razer is holding an event to launch a new phone, most likely the Razer Phone 2. The livestream starts at 6:30 p.m. PT/ 9:30 p.m. ET and it's expected the company will announce a phone of some sort, and we're betting is the Razer Phone 2. CNET received an invite to the Oct. 10 event back in September and while there isn't a specific mention of the follow-up to the original Razer Phone, the outline drawn on the invitation looks exactly like a phone. Also, we know there's been a new Razer Phone in the works for a few weeks now. Razer also recently, albeit temporarily, slashed the price of the original Razer Phone by $300 to $400 (the original price was $700). Was that a means to clear out some inventory before the new phone arrives? Possibly, but we'll have to wait until Wednesday night to know for sure. The original Razer Phone, released late last year, was the company's first flagship Android phone. CNET praised the phone for its ultrasmooth Android performance with its 120Hz screen and impressive speakers, but its camera left a lot to be desired, especially in low-light situations.

CNET,Snapcrap lets you take pictures of poop on sidewalks and report it to the city,10/09/18,https://www.cnet.com/news/snapcrap-lets-you-take-pictures-of-poop-on-sidewalks-and-report-it-to-the-city/," Snapcrap borrows from Snapchat's imagery but makes it poop-themed. A new app called Snapcrap lets users take pictures of human poop on San Francisco's sidewalks or streets and send them to the city's Public Works Department to initiate a cleanup. Snapcrap, which launched on iOS last week and on Android on Tuesday, uses your phone's GPS to determine the exact location of the feces. You can also track recent tickets to make sure the issue is resolved. The app borrows from Snapchat's imagery, replacing the ghost logo with one of poop. ""See something gross? Just snap a photo and press submit,"" Snapcrap's App Store description reads. It sends a report to San Francisco's 311 hotline. San Francisco is working to deal with its dirty streets as it struggles with issues of homelessness. To help combat the problem, it established a ""Poop Patrol"" in August, made up of five public works employees who patrol the streets and steam-clean dirty areas. The city also has a 311 app where people can report feces, as well as other things like graffiti or the need for streetlight repairs or tree maintenance. San Francisco Public Works didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Snapcrap. Snapcrap creator Sean Miller told the Los Angeles Times he was inspired to create the app after moving from Vermont to San Francisco and discovering he had to frequently step over human and animal poop. ""Pretty much everyone who lives here is pretty well accustomed to seeing this stuff when you're walking down the street in every neighborhood,"" Miller told the publication. ""It's very frustrating. You should be able to pull out your phone, take a photo and send it to the city to have it cleaned up."" Miller told CNET that there are around 200 to 300 new Snapcrap users each day. The app could prove to be helpful. But it might not be very pleasant for the city employees who'll be receiving all these poop pictures."
CNET,Verizon praises itself for aiding first responders after it throttled their data,10/09/18,https://www.cnet.com/news/verizon-praises-itself-for-aiding-first-responders-after-it-throttled-their-data/," Verizon pulled a video from YouTube after criticism. A new Verizon's ad that touts the company's help for firefighters hasn't played well. On Monday, the carrier giant released a video on YouTube about helping first responders. It then quickly removed the video from the social network after it became the target of criticism on Reddit, where users pointed out that Verizon had throttled firefighters' mobile data during the Mendocino Complex fire in California a few months earlier. One user wrote: ""'false advertising' -- they didn't list the 'stop saving lives to buy more data cause you ran out' feature I hear they carry."" Another Redditor noted the growing number of dislikes the video was getting on YouTube and wondered if Verizon had noticed. ""I wonder how many till Verizon says ""hey guys this isn't getting a good response, maybe we should take it down,"" the Redditor wrote. The video can still be seen on Verizon's website, where it's introduced by two Verizon representatives. Verizon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Verizon was widely criticized for throttling data for firefighters in California. In August, the company said it had lifted all speed caps for first responders on the West Coast battling wildfires, as well as for emergency workers in Hawaii fighting Hurricane Lane. Verizon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment."
CNET,Pixel 3 XL vs. iPhone XS Max vs. Note 9 vs. LG V40,10/09/18,https://www.cnet.com/news/pixel-3-xl-vs-iphone-xs-max-galaxy-note-9-lg-v40-thinq/," Pixel 3 XL has two front-facing cameras an a screen notch. Google announced the 5.5-inch Pixel 3 and 6.3-inch Pixel 3 XL today, giving lovers of large-screen phones the impossible task of choosing from at least four major brands. The talent here runs deep, with the iPhone XS Max, Galaxy Note 9 and new LG V40 ThinQ all boasting camera prowess and raw internal power. The V40 in particular can wag its three rear cameras at the Pixel 3 phones' single rear lens. (This third-generation Pixel XL does take a cue from LG by adding a second 8-megapixel front-facing wide-angle lens to make selfies with a large group easier to capture.) Read: Everything about the Pixel 3 and 3 XL you need to know Meanwhile, these high-priced phones, which inch close to or have crossed the $1,000 mark, are feeling pressure from cheaper-but-good phones from OnePlus, Motorola and Nokia. Note that we've reviewed every phone except the Pixel 3 XL, so we have to hold off final judgment until then. For now, here's how the specs line up. Scroll to the end for a full specs comparison chart. Does this surprise you? The iPhone XS Max has the largest screen of the four, with a 6.5-inch display. The V40 and Galaxy Note 9 come in at 6.4 inches apiece and the Pixel 3 XL has a 6.3-inch display. But it's the LG V40 that has the highest pixel density, edging the others. We'll scrutinize them further in a number of lighting conditions, but all should excel at watching videos, reading stories and keeping up with social networks. Our mega camera comparisons are still to come -- they take gargantuan effort, but are worth waiting for. What we can tell you is that the LG, iPhone and Galaxy phones are muscle-bound with camera options and tools. The LG V40's three rear cameras are especially braggadocious. For example, you can take a photo from each rear camera at the same time to either use individually or to stitch together. All four of these phones lean on AI camera software. The V40 and Note 9 change your settings when it senses one of almost 20 scenes (e.g. pets, blue sky). And the V40 and iPhone XS Max take dramatic photos with digital lighting effects. The Pixel 3XL can take wide-angle selfies and promises clean, crisp low-light photos that never need a flash, and excellent digital zoom. Later on, Google will also add a tool that picks your best shot for you when the motion setting is turned on -- so even if the photo you snapped is a complete blur, the Pixel 3 may have still captured something better. At stake here is the importance of the multicamera trend. Google's single rear lens throws down the gauntlet against phones with multiple rear cameras, like the V40's (and Huawei P20 Pro's) three rear cameras apiece. Are they really necessary for producing terrific shots or mostly window dressing to impress buyers and set the phonemakers apart? Count them: 1, 2, 3 rear cameras on the LG V40 ThinQ. On the other hand, Google seems to think that a second lens does make a difference on the front-facing camera. We'll need to test these phones pretty exhaustively to see what the camera results tell us. Even just a few years ago, a 64-gigabyte repository of storage was pretty standard. Now, times have changed. LG and Google offer you 64GB just to start with. Samsung's Galaxy Note 9 ups the ante to 128GB at its lowest price, or you can pay more for 512GB. That doesn't even include the 512GB of external storage you can add with a microSD card. Apple, meanwhile, gives the iPhone XS Max three storage options: 64GB, 256GB and 512GB, with no expandable storage. So although LG's V40 ThinQ does let you expand up to 2 terabytes (in theory; the microSD card market tops out at 512GB right now), the total falls behind Samsung's largest capacity. Google, meanwhile, maxes out at 128GB total, though it gives you unlimited photo storage online with Google Photos. Read also: iPhone XS vs. Galaxy Note 9: What a $1,000 phone buys you Comparing battery run-time on a single charge is tricky because there are so many factors at play. Battery life isn't determined by just the size of the battery (the capacity, measured in milliamp hours, or mAh). There's also an interplay between the processor, how efficient the phone's base level software is in managing resources, and, of course, what you're doing with the phone. The LG V40's battery has a smaller capacity than the Pixel 3 XL and Note 9. However, in real-world usage, LG's flagship phone is more than capable of taking you through your normal day. Apple won't supply specific battery capacity and instead provides vague, relative descriptions. For example, the iPhone XS Max is said to last 90 minutes longer on a single charge than the iPhone X. Our iPhone XS and XS Max battery tests are still ongoing, so we'll have more data in the near future. Here's CNET's video drain test protocol, which we weigh in addition to real-world observation. The LG V40 takes dramatic portrait selfies through those two cameras up front. All four phones have wireless charging and waterproofing, so the main differences come down to camera performance and their individual claims to fame. The Galaxy Note 9 has its S Pen stylus (which now also works as a remote), the V40 its five cameras and the iPhone XS Max its FaceID, Memoji animations and portrait lighting mode (the V40 has portrait lighting, too). The Pixel 3 XL promises incredible zoom and pin-sharp photos quality even in low light. The value of these extras comes down to personal preference. For example, if you're enchanted by photography, portrait mode expertise might call to you. If you're a power user who likes the tactile use of a stylus, then the Galaxy Note 9 has no rival. The best phone deals hinge on seasonal promotions. The Pixel 3 XL and LG V40 ThinQ are the least-expensive big phones of the bunch in absolute terms, but depending on which carrier or store you buy it through, the savings may not amount to much. In the US, for example, the V40 sells from $900 to $980. For a little more, you could get a phone with a stylus or longer battery life (the Galaxy Note 9), or access to Apple's customer service at its retail stores (iPhone XS Max).The Pixel 3 XL is more straightforward, selling for either $900 (64GB) or $1,000 (128GB). There's also the question of storage. For the maximum capacity, the Galaxy Note 9 gives you the best deal of them all, though if you're trying to get to 512GB, you'll save money buying an LG V40 and making up the difference with a microSD card. For the best deal, keep an eye on seasonal promotions. That may very well shift the balance for you one way or another when buying any phone.

CNET,"Pixel 3 and 3 XL: Google's new phones are slick, but seem to lack that killer feature",10/09/18,https://www.cnet.com/reviews/google-pixel-3-preview/," The Pixel 3, left, has no notch. The Pixel 3 XL, right, does. Google announced its Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL phones earlier on Tuesday -- here's everything Google announced -- touting a few enhanced features on what are otherwise painfully neutral-looking and iterative phones. Google avoided sharing concrete specs, and showed us a phone that looks nearly identical to 2017's Pixel 2 ($649 at Google Store). There's no killer feature in sight. But holding the 5.5-inch Pixel 3 and 6.3-inch Pixel 3 XL in my hand was a different story. These are sleek, almost slippery devices with rounded edges and thoughtfully curved elements, like the slightly tacky clear panel on the back. So far, I really like what I see -- not because it's innovative (it isn't, really) but because it's appealing to hold and use. If performance holds up during our testing, I can see how this could be a go-to phone for Android fans. Both new Pixel 3 devices come in black, white and ""Not Pink,"" with an extremely subtle two-tone backing and an accent on the power/lock button. In fact, everything about the Pixel 3 is subtle, and that could very well be the phone's main strength. Google's Pixel brand has garnered a following for its overall reliability (minus that pesky Pixel 2 XL screen issue); clean, ""pure"" Android; regular security and OS updates; and the camera's ability to do arguably more with a single lens than other phones do with two or three. The Pixel 3 phones do get a features facelift. You get two front-facing cameras (for group selfies), wireless charging support, Pixel USB-C earbuds in the box and still come in under the $1,000 starting price of the iPhone XS ($999 at Sprint) and Note 9. The Pixel 3 starts at $799 (£739, AUD$1,199), while the Pixel 3XL starts at $899 (£869, AUD$1,349). Pay $100 (or £100) more per phone to double the storage space from 64GB to 128GB. These are still pricey flagship models by any measure, but in a mobile landscape with ballooning costs, Google's comparative restraint could help draw buyers who balk at higher-priced phones. You can preorder the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL now. US residents can buy either phone starting on Oct. 18, followed by sales in other countries starting Nov. 1. In the US, the Pixels sell with Verizon, unlocked through Google's online store, and through Google Project Fi. Pixel 3 in Not Pink is pretty accurate. Shot with things that are actually pretty pink, and things that are actually pretty white #madebygoogle #Pixel3 @CNET pic.twitter.com/9o7lcI7kTs Scroll to the end for a full specs comparison chart versus the iPhone XS, Galaxy S9 and LG V40 ThinQ. Google's Pixel cameras have always been less about flashy gimmicks and more about the kind of software processing that Google can milk from its equipment. After all, Google is a software company at its core. Computer learning and camera AI are major ingredients in the Pixel 3. Both phones have a single 12.2-megapixel rear camera and two 8-megapixel lenses on the front. Here are some camera highlights: HDR+: Turned on by default, this combines eight frames into one shot. Super Res Zoom: Promises sharp, clear detail when you digitally zoom in to a scene -- that's without a telephoto lens. Night Sight: Google promises clear, bright low-light photos without the need for a flash, which can blow out shots or make them unnaturally bright. This will build off Google's already considerable low-light strength. Photobooth mode: Turn on this setting and the Pixel 3 will snap photos when the subject smiles or makes a funny face. Top Shot: When motion capture is turned on, Top Shot, which arrives ""later,"" will recommend a better version of a shot you may have missed. It's intended for correcting candid photos, like someone cannonballing into a pool. You can also choose your own from what the phone grabbed while the motion capture was on. The Pixel 3 XL, left, and 3, in Not Pink. Group selfie: This isn't so much a convenient mode or button you press as you flipping the camera toward yourself and manually zooming out to the wide-angle lens. Playground: For AR enthusiasts, swipe a button in the camera to toss characters, including Star Wars' BB-8, Marvel's Iron Man and Childish Gambino (aka Donald Glover) into the landscape you see through the viewfinder. The moment I picked up the Pixel 3, the newest version of Google's new OS, Android 9 Pie, stared me right in the face. As anyone with Android Pie already on their phone can tell you, not much has changed since we first saw it at Google I/O. As far as I'm concerned, that's both good and bad. Pie relies on gestures to swipe up and press a virtual button to go Home. You long-press this to raise Google Assistant. But if you want to go back, you have to press a Back arrow off to the side, which is confusing and interruptive. This isn't Google's best design, and other Android phones do it much better. Swipe up to see your app tray and you're also brought to a juddery stop midway through as the view on your screen divides into two parts. Up top you have recent apps you can open (like a shortcut). Down below, you see the upper part of your app tray. You have to swipe again to access all your apps. Despite these user hurdles, Android 9 felt very fast and smooth throughout. The redesigned menus and buttons are familiar, but get enough of a fresh coat of paint to feel new. This story updates frequently. It was last updated Oct. 9 at 1:30 p.m. ET.

CNET,"Pixel 3, Google Home Hub and Pixel Slate: Everything Google just announced",10/09/18,https://www.cnet.com/news/pixel-3-google-hub-and-pixel-slate-everything-google-just-announced/," Google's new gear. To celebrate its 10th anniversary, Google's annual fall hardware event proved to be not quite as jam-packed as Amazon's recent surprise clown-car-full of announcements, but the company did announce the long-expected new phones, plus a tablet, laptop, smart home hub and AR partnerships with Marvel and Childish Gambino. Some might also say Google hopes the Pixel 3 and Home Hub dazzle you enough to brush off privacy concerns. And that doesn't include its pre-event announcements, including its Assassin's Creed beta test of its Chrome-based Project Stream cloud gaming architecture. Or, the company's decision to shut down Google+ after exposing thousands of users' data. While it wasn't officially announced, Google also update its Chromecast streaming dongle -- now with 5GHz support. The Pixels were widely and completely leaked before the event, so there were few surprises when it came to Google's update to last year's Pixel 2 and its big brother, the Pixel 2 XL. Google Home, the company's smart speaker with Google Assistant built-in, gets a little brother with a screen -- but without a camera. The Pixel Slate is a brand-new, detachable-style follow-up to the Pixelbook, the company's great but pricey Chrome OS laptop. Since we're seeing growth in $600-class Chrome OS detachables and convertibles, it's unsurprising that Google took this approach. The Pixel Slate.

CNET,"Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL start at $799, rock two selfie cameras and bigger screens",10/09/18,https://www.cnet.com/news/pixel-3-xl-start-at-799-announced-bigger-screens-wide-angle-selfie-dual-camera/," No more leaks! Google's new Pixel phones have finally been unveiled. The Pixel 3 will start at $799 and £739 while the Pixel 3 XL starts at $899 and £869. The Pixel Stand, a wireless charger that works with the phones, will sell for $79 and £69. US residents can preorder the phones now with shipping starting on Oct. 17. People in the UK can preorder now with phones arriving Nov. 1. More markets will be added Nov. 1. Google formally showed off the new flagship phones on Tuesday after weeks of leaks, including a full unboxing video from Engadget. Google even teased the leaks in a tweet, writing, ""so you think you know…"" The Pixel 3 will challenge the best phones on the market with Google's greatest weapon: artificial intelligence. The AI features unveiled at the event give Google something new to crow about. After all, many of the phone's hardware specs -- like the 5.5-inch and 6.3-inch displays on the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL, respectively, and 64GB and 128GB storage options -- had already been leaked. Rick Osterloh, senior vice president of hardware, started the event by showing off all the AI tools the Pixel 3 will be able to use with the help of Google Assistant. ""They come at the intersection of AI, software and hardware working together,"" he said. ""This approach is what makes Google's hardware experience so unique and it unlocks all kinds of helpful benefits.""He talked up the Pixel 3's ability to improve the phone's camera by using AI relying on data gathered from millions of Google Image searches.""Pixel's camera completely rethinks how images are captured,"" Osterloh said. ""We can trace that intelligence back to Google Images."" In a blog post, Google called the Pixel 3 the ""most helpful device in your life,"" pointing out that Assistant can answer while the phone is charging and the camera is designed so that it ""won't miss a shot."" The camera comes with a feature called Top Shot, which uses AI to pick the best moments to take a picture. Other features include Night Sight, used in low-light settings without a flash, and Super Res Zoom, which improves zooming without losing image quality. The Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL come in three colors, each with cheeky names: Just Black, Clearly White and Not Pink. The phones have glass backs with matte and glossy textures in two-tone backing. Both phones are larger than last year's models, with the Pixel 3 at 5.5 inches and the Pixel 3 XL at 6.3 inches. The Pixel 3 has two front-facing cameras to fit more details in the frame, which will be particularly useful for group selfies. Google said the second camera captures ""184 percent more of the scene"" as the iPhone XS, so if you need a wide angle the Pixel 3 might be your best bet. Google Pixel 3 comes with a feature called Top Shot to prevent some bad photos. The Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL will be Google's third time at bat against hardware rivals such as Apple, Samsung and Amazon. Google unveiled its first Pixel phones in 2016, signaling the company was investing more in its own branded hardware to compete with Apple and Samsung in the premium segment. It's now one of the premier Android smartphones despite a deeper bench of phone makers in the market. Since then, the company has invested more heavily in its Made by Google device lineup, which includes everything from virtual reality headset Daydream to its Chromecast video and audio streaming dongles. The goal is to compete with Apple, Samsung and Amazon in an effort to get its gadgets into your pocket and home. Specifically, Google has been pushing its Assistant software, a digital helper akin to Amazon's Alexa or Apple's Siri, in a quest to meet users -- and their data -- everywhere in their daily lives. In May, Google said 500 million devices with Assistant on them had shipped globally. The devices include speakers, phones and TVs. The company also said Assistant now partners with 5,000 household connected devices, up from 1,500 in January. Google wants to sell you phones and smart speakers because it knows people are searching in ways very different from desktop queries to google.com. They're asking their Google Home devices to play curated playlists or using maps on their smartphones to navigate to their favorite restaurants. The more Google knows about you and your interests, the more valuable its ads become to marketers who pay the company to target potential buyers based on their likes, dislikes, age, interests and location. The company rakes in about 90 percent of its $100 billion in annual sales from advertising.

CNET,How to delete your Google+ account,10/09/18,https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-delete-your-google-account-data-breach/," Google announced on Monday that it will sunset the consumer version of its social network Google+ by the end of August 2019 after a vulnerability exposed the personal data of up to 500,000 users between 2015 and March 2018. A review of Google+ as part of the company's Project Strobe ""crystallized what we've known for a while: that while our engineering teams have put a lot of effort and dedication into building Google+ over the years, it has not achieved broad consumer or developer adoption, and has seen limited user interaction with apps,"" Ben Smith, Google fellow and vice president of Engineering, wrote in a blog post. ""The consumer version of Google+ currently has low usage and engagement: 90 percent of Google+ user sessions are less than 5 seconds."" The review found no misuse of the data and the problem was fixed in March, but the company's privacy and data protection office said the vulnerability didn't meet the threshold of security issues to notify users of the data breach. According to a report published Monday by The Wall Street Journal, the vulnerability wasn't disclosed because Google didn't want to be subjected to regulatory scrutiny from lawmakers. You may have deleted your Google+ profile a long time ago, but if you never did and it's been sitting in hibernation, here's what to do.

On Tuesday, the Facebook-owned photo sharing network rolled out a machine-learning tool that detects bullying in photos and captions. If the AI tool deems a photo unkind or unwelcome, it will send the snap sent to Instagram's community operations team for further review, according to a blog post. The AI tool detects bullying in captions and comments, such as attacks on someone's appearance or well-being, according to an Instagram spokesperson. It also compares, ranks and rates images and captions to find bullying in photos, such as a split-screen image where a person is compared to another person in a negative way. Instagram also introduced a bullying comments filter for live videos. The filter can detect and block offensive words during a live stream. Instagram launched the filter in May for comments on photos and videos in Feed, Explore and Profile. Facebook and Twitter have also launched similar initiatives to limit bullying on their platforms. Twitter put a timeline in place last October to remove things like nudity and hateful imagery from its platform. Earlier this month, Facebook added tools to enable users to hide or delete multiple comments at once and allow users to report bullying or harassment on behalf of a friend or family member. In addition, Instagram also added a kindness camera effect with teen author and actor Maddie Ziegler. If you follow Ziegler, you get the effect automatically. In selfie mode, your face is covered in hearts, and you can tag someone to support, according to the blog post. If you switch to the rear camera, you see the word ""kindness"" in different languages. If you don't follow Ziegler on Instagram, you can see someone using the effect and tap ""try it"" to add the filter to your camera. First published on Oct. 9, 8:18 a.m. PT.

CNET,Pixel phones to begin making Google Duplex AI voice calls in November,10/09/18,https://www.cnet.com/news/google-duplex-ai-arrives-in-november-on-pixel-phones-boosting-google-assistant/," Google's Rick Osterloh touted his company's combination of hardware, software and artificial intelligence technology at its Pixel 3 event. Google Duplex, technology to let human-sounding AI accomplish tasks by talking to people over the phone, will arrive in the real world starting in November on Google's Pixel phones. ""Our new Google Assistant feature, powered by Duplex technology, is able to help users with real-world tasks over a phone, like calling a restaurant to book a table,"" said Brian Rakowski, a vice president of product management, at the Google Pixel 3 launch event Tuesday. ""Pixel phones will be the first to get this feature when it rolls out, city by city, next month."" That indicates the arrival will be gradual and won't reach the vast majority of people who don't have Google's own smartphones. However, it's apparently for any Pixel phone owner, not just for the new Pixel 3. And Google has spread its Google Assistant technology to many other devices and parts of the world, so expect the narrower initial scope to broaden. Google unveiled Duplex in May at its Google I/O conference, wowing people with its realistically human voice and speech mannerisms in demonstrations of making a hair appointment and reserving a table at a restaurant. But this early progress in passing the Turing test -- proving artificial intelligence by convincing humans that they could be talking to fellow Homo sapiens, not a computer -- came with worrisome complications, too. That's why the company later added a disclosure so humans know they're talking to Google Duplex, not a person. Google started limited beta testing of Duplex in June. The Google Assistant technology shows the potential of Google's technology -- its understanding of human voices, its ability to perform sophisticated searches from a vast corpus of information, its Android software to power billions of smartphones. But for it to succeed fully, Google will have to overcome privacy concerns, too. Most of Google's revenue comes from advertising, and much of that advertising is targeted at you on the basis of personal details Google infers from what you share and do online.

CNET,Pixel 3 camera has better resolution and can shoot in the dark with no flash,10/09/18,https://www.cnet.com/news/google-pixel-3-camera-shoots-in-the-dark-better-resolution-top-shot/," Top Shot scans a sequence of photos and recommends what it thinks is the winner of the bunch. With its Pixel 3 phone, Google has improved photography with a feature called Top Shot to avoid unflattering photos, an ability to shoot in the dark with no flash, and a way to zoom in beyond the camera's ordinary resolution known as Super Res Zoom. Top Shot lets you skip photos where people are blinking, frowning and otherwise not looking their best, Google said at its Pixel 3 launch event Tuesday. Smile and blink detection aren't new to the industry, but it's a task well-suited to AI technology where Google excels. The new camera also has a mode called Night Sight that lets you shoot in dark conditions without a flash -- and the unnatural blaring light they often inflict on photos, Google said. Smartphone cameras are a big deal -- for you and for Google. Photography is core to how we share our lives electronically with friends and family and one of the best ways phone manufacturers can make this year's model stand out from last year's. And for Google, a good camera will mean you're more likely to tap into its highly regarded Google Photos service -- which by the way offers unlimited storage for original-resolution photos taken with Pixel phones. ""We've taken the world's best smartphone camera and made it even better,"" said Rick Osterloh, head of Google's hardware efforts. The first Google Pixel, introduced in 2016, and the Google Pixel 2 from 2017 had excellent cameras. But Google so far isn't following the approach of rivals like Apple, LG Electronics and Samsung that are building multiple main cameras into their phones so you can take, for example, wide-angle and telephoto shots. The Google Pixel 3 has a super-wide selfie camera to photograph more people -- and more scenery. Instead of adding a main camera with a longer focal length on the back of the camera, Google added a second wider-angle camera on the front for group selfies. The field of view is 184 percent wider than that of an Apple iPhone XS, said Brian Rakowski, a Google vice president of product management, good for capturing not only more people but also more scenery and more of the photo story. Super Res Zoom combines several photos ""to create a beautiful, zoomed-in shot so you can get closer to the details and frame the shot you want,"" Rakowski said. It's related to technology (called super resolution, by the way) that scientists have used to improve photos of Mars, he added. The Pixel 3 also lets you track moving subjects better with a feature called motion autofocus. It improves its portrait mode with the ability to adjust color saturation, focus point and depth of field. And a photo booth mode automatically takes a shot when you smile or make a funny face so you don't need to fool with pushing the shutter button. Superior camera technology has been a hallmark of the Pixel line. It married high-quality image sensors with new image-processing smarts to help set new standards for smartphone photography. Google's core approach -- combining multiple underexposed shots into one photo -- is now part of the highly regarded new iPhone XS camera system. One of Google's camera engineers is Marc Levoy, who as a Stanford professor invented the term ""computational photography."" The term, while broad, generally refers to using computer processing to reach beyond physical camera hardware limits."
CNET,Google Pixel users can screen spam calls,10/09/18,https://www.cnet.com/news/google-pixel-users-can-screen-spam-calls/," Google unveiled its latest Pixel smartphone, touting tons of intelligent features. Google promises you'll never have to answer another robocall again. That's thanks to some new smarts coming to its Pixel smartphones via the Google Assistant. Users can now screen spam calls and get a real time transcription of the call so they can decide whether to answer, hang up, or block the number and report it as spam. Google already offers a way to filter calls suspected of being spam. But this new feature goes further, letting you get more information before you pick up a call from a questionable number. Spam calls and robocalls, which use autodialers, are on the rise, in spite of efforts from the Federal Communications Commission to curb them. Ridding the world of unwanted robocalls is tricky business, since some legitimate communications are made using automated call technology. Those include weather alerts and messages from schools, public utilities and political organizations. Google's Call Screen feature offers another tool that could make it easier to help distinguish legitimate calls from unwanted spam. Google announced the feature on Tuesday during an event in New York City where it introduced the new Pixel 3 smartphone along with a slew of other hardware products. The feature will also be coming to existing Pixel phones. Google's launch event arrives as the search giant has become more serious about its hardware business. Three years ago, the company unveiled its first Pixel Phone and Google Home smart speaker. Since then, Google has invested more heavily in its ""Made by Google"" device lineup, which includes everything from virtual reality headsets to video and audio streaming devices. The Pixel 3 and the Pixel 3XL go on sale in the US starting Oct. 19 and will be available in more markets on Nov. 1. Pricing will start at $799 for the Pixel 3 and $899 for the Pixel 3 XL. The Pixel 3 is poised to compete head-to-head with the best phones on the market, and Google is putting its strongest feature -- artificial intelligence -- front and center. On Google's blog, the company called the Pixel 3 the ""most helpful device in your life,"" pointing out that the Smart Assistant can answer while the phone is charging and that the camera is designed so that it ""won't miss a shot.""

CNET,"Pixel 3 includes USB-C headphones, dongle in the box",10/09/18,https://www.cnet.com/news/pixel-3-includes-usb-c-headphones-dongle-in-the-box/," Google's Pixel USB-C earbuds. Google's new Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL will come with a new accessory in the box: a pair of wired Pixel Bud-style earbuds. The phones, unveiled at a Google event on Tuesday, come with the new Google Pixel USB-C earbuds, as well as a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter for using legacy headphones. The new wired earbuds are available only in white, and they include an in-line remote and adjustable loops. In fact, they look very much like a wired version of the wireless Pixel Buds released in 2017. The new model, available now, is $30 if bought separately (£30 in the UK -- Australia pricing wasn't immediately available but roughly converts to AU$40). It's the first time Google has bundled headphones with its Pixel phones -- last year it offered only the dongle. The omission of headphones has always been a curious move by Google, given that it's a standard accessory for most phone makers. And the Pixel, as Google's marquee Android smartphone, is competing with a number of flagship devices crowding the market. By contrast, Apple has pulled the 3.5mm dongle from its 2018 iPhones, though it still ships them with iPhone-compatible Lightning headphones in the box. Meanwhile, Samsung and LG remain among the few phone manufacturers that still offer a traditional 3.5mm headphone jack in their phones, obviating the need for such dongles. In addition to the headphones, the Pixel 3 XL will include two charging cables: USB-C to USB-A (for traditional chargers), as well as a USB-C-to-USB-C. Despite rumors, Google didn't announce new wireless Pixel Buds at the Tuesday event. Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL: What you need to know about Google's new smartphones.

CNET,Google's Pixel Stand charges your phone and wakes you with a fake sunrise,10/09/18,https://www.cnet.com/news/googles-pixel-stand-charges-your-phone-and-wakes-you-with-a-fake-sunrise/," Getting a Pixel 3? Take a stand. Google announced the latest version of its flagship phone, the Pixel 3, on Tuesday. While there's plenty exciting about the phone itself, Google's Pixel accessories game is strong this year. Alongside the phone, it's introducing the Pixel Stand, a smart charging pad equipped with the smarts of Google Assistant. The stand props your phone up at an angle and will charge even if your phone is wearing a case. When the Pixel 3 is on the Stand, you can communicate with Google Assistant either via voice command if you're across the room, or using one-touch gestures if you're sitting right by it. You could pop the Pixel Stand on your office desk, it seems like it would be best placed on your nightstand, thanks to the smart alarm clock features it brings to the Pixel. The screen will slowly brighten, turning yellow (like the sun, get it?) ahead of your alarm sounding to wake you up in the morning. Thanks to Google Assistant knowing your morning routine, the Stand can then prompt your phone to show you the weather, traffic information and news headlines tailored to your preferences. Come nighttime, the Stand will automatically turn your phone to Do Not Disturb. The Stand, which works with any Qi compatible device, will retail at $79 (£69) and will be available next month with the Pixel 3."
CNET,"Google unveils Marvel, Childish Gambino AR partnerships at Pixel event",10/09/18,https://www.cnet.com/news/google-announces-marvel-childish-gambino-ar-partnerships-at-pixel-event/," Hulk and Iron Man made cameos at Tuesday's Google event. Google has made it possible for you to join the Avengers, unveiling a new AR team-up with Marvel Studios as part of a big hardware event the search giant held Tuesday in New York. At the event, Liza Ma, a Google product manager, and Brian Rakowski, vice president of product management, also revealed that the company is working with actor and rapper Donald Glover to bring his Childish Gambino stage personal to Playground, the Google Pixel's ""evolved"" augmented reality sticker brand. Childish Gambino showed up too. Stickers are incorporated into the Google Pixel phone's front and rear cameras. In a demonstration video, animations of Iron Man and the Hulk are layered onto a photo of a city rooftop. ""These characters are rendered to feel lifelike in the scene and they even interact with each other,"" said Ma of the Marvel heroes. She noted the characters can respond to your actions and facial expressions, giving the sense that they're in the scene with you. ""Create and play with the world around you,"" the search giant tweeted. ""With Playground, your Pixel 3 photos and videos come to life with cameos from superheroes, animated stickers and fun captions."" Playground is launching on Pixel 3, and will roll out on Pixel 1 and 2. The company didn't provide a start date for the rollout, but Ma said it would be ""soon.""

CNET,Google hopes Pixel 3 razzle-dazzle will blind you to its privacy problems,10/09/18,https://www.cnet.com/news/google-hopes-pixel-3-home-hub-dazzle-blinds-you-to-privacy-concerns/," Google Hardware Chief Rick Osterloh announced new devices on Tuesday. When Google pushes a device like its new Pixel 3 phone, it's not really about the phone. It's about all the ways the hunk of metal and glass can get you to use Google's software -- and, as a result, help the company find out more information about you. But what if your faith in Google's ability to protect your data is shaken? That question formed the undercurrent to a busy Tuesday event at which the internet search giant unveiled several new consumer gadgets, including updated Pixel phones, a smart display called the Home Hub, and a tablet, the Pixel Slate, with a detachable keyboard. The event followed by just a day the revelation that Google had put the data of 500,000 people at risk because of a bug in a developer tool found in its Google+ social network. Google said it discovered and fixed the bug in March but decided not to disclose the vulnerability because the flaw didn't meet the company's internal ""thresholds"" for informing the public. The timing of the news, which came out after a report by The Wall Street Journal, raises questions about Google's commitment to protecting the personal information of its billions of users. The launch comes amid an uptick of criticism over the company's data collection practices and, thanks to Facebook, increasing consumer scrutiny over how customer information is being used. It's just the latest test of our trust in Google. In July, the Journal reported that employees at the companies behind some third-party Gmail apps could read your inbox if you integrated those apps with your Gmail account. A month later, the Associated Press reported that Google was still tracking users even if they'd turned off a setting called Location History. In the case of Google+, the search giant said it found no evidence any data was abused, but as a result of the incident it decided to shut down the social network for good. On Tuesday, Google didn't address those privacy concerns directly, but it did give a nod toward security. ""We're committed to the security of our users,"" Rick Osterloh, Google's hardware chief, said during the event in New York City. ""We need to offer simple, powerful ways to safeguard your devices."" Osterloh mentioned products like Google Play Protect for Android devices and Titan, a security key Google released in August that's been integrated into the company's mobile hardware. Still, Google tried to turn the attention to the latest bells and whistles, and not privacy woes. The company announced new features that take better group selfies, and a screening feature for the Pixel 3 that lets you avoid calls from telemarketers. Google also announced a revamped version of the Google Home app and a wireless charging device for the Pixel. Whatever the specifics of the hardware, data is the lifeblood of Silicon Valley. Google wants to sell you phones and smart speakers because it knows people aren't searching for things on Google.com from their desktop computers as much anymore. They're telling their Google Home devices to play curated playlists, or using maps on their smartphones to navigate to their favorite restaurants. The more Google knows about you and your interests, the more valuable its ads become to marketers who pay the company to target potential buyers based on their likes, dislikes, age, interests and even location. Alphabet, Google's parent company, makes about 90 percent of its $100 billion in annual sales from advertising. But while the software giants of Silicon Valley have mined data for years, hardware has also become a key part of their business. Amazon first unveiled its Alexa assistant and Echo smart speaker in 2014. Last month, it unveiled a deluge of new products, including a wall clock, subwoofer and microwave. Facebook joined the fray on Monday, announcing its long-rumored video chat device, called Portal. In a sense, Facebook's and Google's problems are similar but flipped. Facebook has spent the last two years reckoning with a crisis of user trust. The social network is still reeling from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which the UK-based digital consultancy co-opted the personal data of roughly 87 million people without their permission. And two weeks ago, Facebook disclosed a massive hack that affected 50 million people. In the face of all that, the social network still decided that now is a good time to sell hardware for your living room. Google has sold hardware for years, and it got really serious about the market three years ago. In 2016, the company tapped Osterloh, a former Motorola executive, to lead a dedicated team focused on creating consumer devices. Last year, Google paid $1 billion to bulk up its hardware engineering ranks through a deal with Chinese manufacturer HTC. But now, after getting a relatively free pass as Facebook has endured a barrage of scandals, Google has been getting hammered for its treatment of data. Consumers will have to decide if those privacy questions will have any impact. Unlike Facebook, Google has built up years of credibility with its hardware. The cornerstone was the Nexus program, a beloved but niche line of phones that ran ""stock"" Android -- a bare-bones version of Google's mobile operating system without the flourishes or extra apps that carriers and manufacturers usually add to the software. Each year, Google worked with a different hardware partner, including LG, Huawei and HTC, to put out the phones. The goal wasn't necessarily to become a market leader or make money. It was to be a showcase for Google software or to demonstrate to other hardware makers what their devices could look like. Three years ago, the company shifted its strategy to focus on its own ""Made by Google"" line. In 2016, Google unveiled its first Pixel Phone and Google Home smart speaker. Now the suite of products includes everything from virtual reality headsets to video and audio streaming devices. Google's pitch is that its hardware products can tap into its 20-year history as a search company and all of the advancements it's made in computing. ""The big breakthroughs we're going to see are not in hardware alone,"" Osterloh said. ""They come at the intersection of artificial intelligence, software and hardware.""

CNET,Google Lens is directly integrated in Google's Pixel 3,10/09/18,https://www.cnet.com/news/google-lens-is-directly-integrated-in-googles-pixel-3/," Point Google Lens at a picture of sunglasses, and it'll try to help you find a pair online. The Google Lens augmented-reality tool is directly integrated into Google's new Pixel 3 phone, Google said Tuesday at a launch event for several new products. Lens unlocks previously announced capabilities like Style Search, which identifies products online that're similar to the one you're pointing your phone's camera at, or a feature that gives you the option of having your phone autodial a number in an ad when you snap a picture of it. Lens also works offline without a data connection, the company said. Google Lens is a visual search tool that uses your phone's camera to let you find more information on real world objects. Google first announced the tool two years ago, and initially released it last year, exclusively with the Pixel 2 phone. Lens isn't an app, but a tool Google is embedding into its other services. For example, in Google Maps, you can use Lens to help orient you while using walking navigation. Google Lens also lets you point your phone at a book to see background on the author, along with reviews and info on where to buy it. Point Lens at a storefront, and you'll see business information and reviews. Point it at a flower, and you can tell what species it is. The Google launch event arrives as the search giant has become more serious about its hardware business. Three years ago, the company unveiled its first Pixel Phone and Google Home smart speaker. Since then, Google has invested more heavily in its ""Made by Google"" device lineup, which includes everything from virtual reality headsets to video and audio streaming devices. The goal is to compete with Apple, Samsung and Amazon to get its gadgets into your pocket and home. Specifically, Google has been pushing its Assistant software, a digital helper akin to Amazon's Alexa or Apple's Siri, in a quest to meet users -- and their data -- everywhere in their daily lives. In May, Google announced that 500 million devices have shipped globally with the Assistant on them, including speakers, phones and TVs. The company also said the Assistant now partners with 5,000 household connected devices, up from 1,500 in January.

CNET,The new Pixel Slate starts at $599,10/09/18,https://www.cnet.com/news/the-new-pixel-slate-starts-at-599/," One of the worst-kept tech secrets in recent history is officially out of the bag. Google has announced a new tablet, the Pixel Slate, alongside a handful of other new products including the Pixel 3 phone and Home Hub. The Pixel Slate starts at $599 (or £549) and comes in a variety of configurations; the most expensive model, which features Intel's eighth-gen Core i7 CPU, 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, costs $1,599 (or £1,549). Google said the Pixel Slate would ship later this year; you can sign up now to be notified of availability on the Google Store. In keeping with much of the information that leaked prior to today's event, the midnight blue tablet has a 12.3-inch display and runs Google's Chrome operating system. It measures just over a quarter-inch thick and weighs 1.6 pounds. Google also announced two optional accessories -- the $199 Pixel Keyboard and $99 Pixelbook Pen. Here's what we know so far about the Pixel Slate: The $199 Pixel Slate Keyboard features rounded, backlit keys and connects magnetically; it does not require power or charging. In opting to not include the keyboard with the tablet, Google is following Microsoft's controversial model with the Surface Pro keyboard, which costs an extra $160. But Google's total package is less expensive than Microsoft's; the Pixel Slate, keyboard and stylus cost $900 compared to the Surface Pro, keyboard and stylus bundle, which runs $1,160.

CNET,"New iPad Pro 2018: All the rumors on specs, price, new Apple Pencil, USB-C, possible October debut",10/09/18,https://www.cnet.com/news/new-ipad-pro-2018-all-the-rumors-on-specs-price-new-apple-pencil-possible-october-debut/," There's buzz about a major redesign coming to the iPad Pro in 2018. We're just a few weeks away from the release of the iPhone XR on Oct. 26, and the rumors suggest that Apple may have other new products waiting in the wings -- including a new iPad Pro or two. How to: Preorder the iPhone XR It was just last month that the company hosted a big event to show off the XR alongside the new iPhone XS, XS Max and Apple Watch 4. But Apple has had follow-on hardware events in October before -- most recently, in 2016, when it announced three new MacBook Pros and the TV app. And rumor has it that we're due for a second fall show in 2018 that could include a new MacBook Air, higher-end AirPods and a smaller HomePod as well as refreshes of other aging Apple products. But the rumors with the most momentum involve the new iPad Pro; sources report that Apple will introduce a fresh batch of its high-end tablet before the end of this year. The recent release of the iOS 12.1 beta reportedly includes references to eight ""iPad2018Fall"" devices -- two Wi-Fi models and two LTE models in each size -- according to 9to5Mac, as well as evidence of a new version of Face ID, USB-C connectivity and output support for 4K displays. When the company debuted the latest iPad in March, adding Pencil support and a faster processor, it whittled down the gap between the entry-level tablet and its Pro siblings. Starting at $329 (£319 or AU$469), the base iPad now offers many of the premium features that were previously exclusive to the considerably more expensive 10.5-inch Pro and 12.9-inch Pro. For the moment, those Pro models still retain exclusive rights to the superior Retina display and Smart Connector, which lets you add a snap-on keyboard. But a chorus of pundits and supply chain sources now suggest that Apple will look to redefine the iPad Pro line -- and justify its higher price -- with a big-time update before the end of the year. Though Apple hasn't announced anything officially, there's a huge amount of buzz about new Pro models surfacing before the end of 2018. Here's what we've heard so far: Editors' note, Oct. 9: This post was originally published on March 21, and will continue to be updated with news and rumors on the 2018 iPad lineup. After the iPad Pro was a no-show at Apple's Sept. 12 event, we immediately looked to October for a follow-on event. The iPad Air 2 and iPad Mini 3 were introduced in a combined Mac and iPad event in October 2014, and it's not so far-fetched to envision a similar event this month that included a new MacBook Air and a new iPad Pro or two. And, yes, November remains a possibility but Apple has never debuted a new iPad in December. Concept renders of an iPad Pro. Bloomberg reports that Apple is prepping two new tablets for late 2018 -- one that measures ""around 11 inches,"" which could be the rough equivalent of the current 10.5-inch model, and a 12.9-inch model. Previously, the publication had reported that Apple was working on at least one new iPad Pro, the 10.5-inch model. Apple has developed a new version of its Pencil stylus, according to 9to5Mac. Like Wacom's EMR stylus -- and Apple's own AirPods -- the new Pencil will automatically detect and pair with the new iPad Pro when nearby, and you'll be able to transition easily between supported Apple devices. We don't know, however, whether the new Pencil will work with older iPad models or whether the older Apple Pencil will work with the new iPads. Microsoft disappointed some when it released a new version of the Surface Pro without a USB-C connection earlier this month. But Apple is reported to have added the popular connection to the new iPad Pro, according to 9to5Mac. In addition to providing power to some accessories, the USB-C port will allow the new iPad Pros to output video to 4K external displays. Mac Otakara and 9to5Mac report that the forthcoming iPad Pros will benefit from a major redesign and integrate several new features that first appeared on the first-gen iPhone X last year. An iPad battery usage icon found in Apple's iOS 12 beta suggests that the upcoming models will look quite a bit different -- with no Home button, slimmer bezels, rounded corners and a bigger display. And the iPhone X's rounded corners may also find their way onto the next iPad Pro, according to 9to5Mac.com. The old iPad icon (left) vs. the new iPad icon found in the iOS 12 beta. There's no notch on those icons but the rumors suggest that the new models' bezels are able to accommodate Face ID without a notch. Developer Steve Troughton-Smith, who has discovered many Apple products and features before they were officially announced, says that the iOS 12 beta shows that future iPads will have Face ID -- and that it will also be able to unlock the device even in landscape mode, something that even the new 2018 iPhones can't do today. (Bloomberg has also reported on this.) Troughton-Smith has also found evidence that suggests that the new iPad may have a USB-C connection. This bolsters an earlier prediction by Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo that Apple will shift to an 18-watt USB-C power adaptor as well as previous reporting by DigiTimes. The current-generation Pro models currently support the 18-watt spec, which can reduce charging time by 50 percent, but Apple ships them today with a 10-12-watt adapter. If true, this would mark a dramatic shift for Apple, which has used the Lightning connector broadly across its hardware lineup since its introduction in 2012. Apple's AirPower wireless charging pad. Don't expect iPhone-style wireless charging, though. No one seriously expects the metallic rear panel in the iPad to go away, and that more or less prevents inductive charging. Mac Otakara reports that the forthcoming iPad Pro -- at least the 10.5-inch model -- will dispense with the traditional headphone jack in favor of Apple's own Lightning Connector. And there's plenty of momentum in this direction: when Apple announced the iPhone XS, XS Max and XR it also stopped selling the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, iPhone 6S and 6S Plus and iPhone SE -- meaning that the last iPhones to come with a headphone jack are gone. The new entry-level iPad is powered by the 2016-era A10 processor, putting it just a half-step behind the iPad Pros, which run the A10X. But considering that the 2017 iPhones run the A11 and the new trio of 2018 iPhones use the A12 Bionic, it only makes sense that newer iPad Pros would have an A11 or A11X -- at the very least. Bloomberg suggested back in November that the next iPads would have faster processors and GPUs, which have become a key component of almost every upgrade cycle. The iPad may take cues from the first-gen iPhone X, inside and out. One iPhone X feature that is unlikely to pop up in an iPad anytime in 2018 is an OLED display, according to Bloomberg. Not because Apple wouldn't like to use them. It's that suppliers simply don't yet have the bandwidth to produce them at the size and cost in the numbers required to address Apple's massive market. (That's the same reason the laptops with OLED screens are still few and far between.) Speaking of iPhones: With September's iPhone line introducing the 6.5-inch iPhone XS Max, it feels like the iPad Mini line just isn't long for this world. Bloomberg reports that the Mini will not be refreshed this year -- and we have to wonder whether it will ever come. Apart from a minor storage capacity upgrade in June 2017, the current Mini 4, with its 7.9-inch screen, hasn't been updated since its introduction in 2015. But it's more expensive than the 9.7-inch iPad because Apple sells only a 128GB version. Given that the new 9.7-incher delivers considerably more -- a bigger screen, Pencil support and better performance -- at a lower price, it's hard to envision that much demand remains for the Mini. 5 features coming to the iPad in iOS 12: Apple didn't forget about the iPad with iOS 12.

CNET,Google Photo Live Albums automatically organizes and shares your photos,10/09/18,https://www.cnet.com/news/google-photos-live-albums-automatically-adds-and-organizes-your-photos/," Ahead of its Pixel event in New York, Google's Photo app just got an interesting update. It's a new feature called Live Albums, and it automatically shares photos of people you select with friends and family. Google Assistant also now has the power to sift through, search and organize your photos neatly into albums. The ability comes in version 4.3 of Google Photos. Live Albums will also enjoy deep integration with the new Google Home Hub smart screen, also unveiled at the event. It'll let the Hub act as a smart digital picture frame. The same goes for the Pixel 3 phones, also launched at the at the event. When docked with the Pixel Stand wireless charger, the handsets will transform into picture frames as well. Google also launched its Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL . This is a developing story."
CNET,This cordless drill comes with all the extras for $53,10/09/18,https://www.cnet.com/news/this-cordless-drill-comes-with-all-the-extras-for-53/," Nice for jobs ranging from small to medium, this Tacklife drill comes with lots of useful accessories. If there's one tool every homeowner needs, it's a cordless drill. Actually, forget homeowners -- every person needs one, because there are countless occasions when you need to tighten a screw, drill a hole and so on, regardless of where you live. At last count there were about a zillion drill bundles out there. This is one is noteworthy because it comes with lots of extras and at a discount: For a limited time, and while supplies last, the Tacklife PCD04B 20V Max cordless drill is $53.19 with promo code GX5V4YX2. It normally sells for $70. Although I'm the family handyman, I'm not what you would call a handy man. But I know enough to recognize what's good about this drill, including its 16 speeds, trigger-powered work light and three modes of operation: drill, screwdriver and hammer. Tacklife also gives you a big bundle of extras including 32 driver bits, 9 drill bits and a driver-bit extender. There's also something I actually don't own but should: A flexible hex shaft for getting screws into or out of tight spaces where a drill won't fit. You get a zippered case to carry everything, too. The battery is removable (and compatible with various other Tacklife tools), and extras will run you about $23. Tacklife backs the whole kit and kaboodle with a 24-month warranty. The PCD04B has an average rating of 4.2 stars out of 5, which is about typical for drills that don't say Black and Decker or Dewalt on them. I've used some other Tacklife tools and found them to be solid. And that's how I'd describe this deal. Not spectacular, but solid. Your thoughts? Bonus deal: Got mesh? By which I mean a mesh network blanketing your home in Wi-Fi? That's usually an expensive proposition, often to the tune of $300 or more. Not today. For a limited time, and while supplies last, the Linksys Velop 3-node whole-home Wi-Fi mesh router is just $169. (Add it to your cart to see that price.) That's from seller Xtremetech -- if you see a different one listed or a different price in your cart, it probably means that seller is sold out. How does the Velop rate? Highly overall, according to CNET's review. The big ding was price, but that was when the kit sold for $500. At $169? Yes, please.

CNET,"Midrange phones are boring, but here's why they're important, too",10/09/18,https://www.cnet.com/news/midrange-phones-are-boring-but-heres-why-theyre-important-too/," Google will announce the Pixel 3 and 3 XL on Tuesday, two more in a wave of premium phones hoping to sweep up buyers ahead of the holiday season and beyond. But as we ooh and ahh over the iPhone XS and Note 9, and yes, the LG V40 and Pixels as well, it's important to remember that not every phone worth buying has to cost you $1,000 or unlock the screen with your face. Midrange phones like the $350 Nokia 7.1 and $480 Moto Z3 seem bland compared to these top-tier treasures, but they serve an important purpose to more people than you think. Although they don't have the most exciting specs or memorable names, these midtier handsets are necessary to bridge the divide between ultracheap, entry-level devices with basic specs and these specimens of peak performance. Midrange phones give most people what they actually need in a mobile device at a far more reasonable cost. This category of devices accounts for almost a third of phone sales worldwide, according to IHS Markit. The analyst firm considers midrange phones to be priced between $150 and $399. (My own definition settles at $300 to $600.) In developing nations and countries like China, midrange phones provide solid, reliable performance for a fraction of the price of superpremium models, which is important in cost-conscious markets, or countries where prices mount from high taxes and tariffs. In mature markets such as the US, where midrange phones make up 10 percent of smartphone sales or less, according to IHS Markit, midtier handsets still fulfill a role. If you lose or break your phone, but still need to pay your monthly carrier fee, you might buy a cheaper, unlocked device from Amazon, Best Buy, NewEgg or manufacturer websites as a stop-gap until you fulfill your contract obligation. Midrange phones are also a good choice for teens who are prone to losing or breaking their devices, or for folks who aren't entranced by next-generation features. At the higher end of the scale, the OnePlus 6T, which will cost $550 when it's announced this fall, is expected to carry on the brand's track record of bringing in high-end, near-premium features for almost half off the major known brands. The OnePlus 6, for example, has the same current-generation Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor as the Galaxy S9, Note 9 and LG V40, takes excellent photos, has up-to-date Android and all the rest. Caught between the whizzbang pizzazz of the $1,000 iPhone XS and Note 9 and the jaw-dropping value of a $250 budget buy, it's easy to pass up phones with prices and features in between. Why? Because frankly, they seem too boring to notice. They have no story. It's a lot harder to sell a $400 phone with an an OK screen, perfectly fine camera, ho-hum battery life and totally functional processor than it is to sell something cutting-edge or really cheap. Cutting-edge has sizzle. Bargain buys save you cash. If you're the type of mobile photographer to fine-tune manual settings or print photos from your phone, by all means, pinpoint which high-end phone will bring you the best camera system for what you want to do. But if you rarely stray past sharing photos through social media or text, and Instagram is a small part of your life, maybe a decent camera on a decent phone will take care of your needs just fine. For some, there are signs that the middle zone of the midrange category could ebb. When it pulled the iPhone SE from its online store in September, Apple quit the midrange market for new phones (you still have the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus at $440 and $569, respectively). That move may be a harbinger of greater industry change. You can't buy the adorable iPhone SE from Apple's store anymore. ""[Apple seems] to have made a conscious decision to vacate that space,"" said Wayne Lam, principal analyst at IHS Markit. ""They want to operate and compete at the higher end of the smartphone category. Now with the global market for new phones slowing, this may be the best business model moving forward."" Be that as it may, there's still a global demand for midprice phones to lessen the sting of more expensive high-end models. As the price of high-end phones balloons to $1,000 or more, a less-fancy phone that saves you hundreds could begin to have greater appeal. So what if it doesn't have waterproofing, five rear cameras or wireless charging? As long as its camera and battery life are good enough for you, and it lets you keep in touch with the world, a ""boring"" phone will keep more money in your pocket without compromising too much where it counts. And you'll still have $500 or so left over to spend on whatever you want. First published Oct. 6, 5 a.m. PT.Updated Oct. 9 at 3:00 a.m. PT: Adds further detail.

OnePlus' next flagship phone, the OnePlus 6T, has an official launch date: Oct. 30. The Chinese phone maker teased the event on Twitter and its website on Monday -- and said it will be its biggest event ever. OnePlus will livestream the announcement starting at 11 a.m. ET (8 a.m. PT) on Oct. 30 on its site as well as its YouTube channel. Fans can also book tickets to attend the event, which is happening at Pier 36 in New York. The 6T is the follow-up to the OnePlus 6 launched earlier this year, which got high marks from CNET for delivering the look, feel and performance of a high-end flagship phone at a significantly lower price. In an exclusive interview with CNET, OnePlus CEO Pete Lau said the 6T won't have a headphone jack, but will have an in-screen fingerprint sensor. T-Mobile is expected to be the exclusive US carrier partner for the OnePlus 6T and it will be optimized for T-Mobile's new 600 megahertz spectrum band network, according to several people familiar with the launch plans. OnePlus will still sell its standard global version that's unlocked and able to run on either AT&T or T-Mobile, as well as most networks internationally."
CNET,"Microsoft's Project xCloud will stream Xbox games to phones, tablets and more",10/08/18,https://www.cnet.com/news/microsoft-reveals-project-xcloud-service-to-stream-xbox-games-to-phones-tablets/," Microsoft's Project xCloud service is in testing. Microsoft revealed Monday that it's testing an Xbox game streaming service, currently called Project xCloud. The company demonstrated its work on the service so far in a video showing Forza and Halo, games designed to be run on an Xbox One console, being played on Android phones and tablets. The games work both with an Xbox wireless controller paired over Bluetooth and using a touchscreen overlay when there's no controller present. ""Project xCloud's state-of-the-art global game-streaming technology will offer you the freedom to play on the device you want without being locked to a particular device,"" wrote Kareem Choudhry, Microsoft's corporate vice president for cloud gaming, in a blog post. When an Xbox controller isn't available, a touch overlay is. Public tests of Microsoft Project xCloud are set to begin in 2019. Microsoft said the tests will help it ""learn and scale with different volumes and locations."" The company has also built custom server hardware that hosts components from multiple Xbox Ones, with plans to scale up as needed. When asked if the test will include non-Xbox games such as those on PC or mobile, a Microsoft spokesperson said the company isn't revealing specific games, but added it hopes the service will allow streaming without having to involve a game developer. ""Our vision is for gamers to have access to the same content via game streaming that they do on other platforms, without any additional work required by the game developer,"" the spokesperson said. An Xbox game-streaming service of some kind was first teased by Microsoft at its E3 2018 press event in June. Game-streaming services themselves aren't new: Sony has its PlayStation Now service; Ubisoft is partnering with Google to have Assassin's Creed Odyssey stream in the Chrome browser; and Capcom's Resident Evil 7 is available on Nintendo Switch in Japan via streaming. But internet speeds, which vary greatly around the world, are often a challenge for these services. For now, Xbox has its Game Pass service, which currently only supplies downloadable games to its subscribers. The PlayStation Now service last month began supporting downloadable games.

CNET,"The easiest way to get library books on your iPhone, Android or Kindle",10/08/18,https://www.cnet.com/how-to/the-easiest-way-to-get-library-books-on-your-iphone-android-or-kindle/," If you're looking for a change from the pileup of those Amazon packages of books that you keep ordering but haven't yet read, try a different strategy: Check out some e-books and audiobooks from your local library via your phone. It's much easier than it used to be. Libby is the much cuter and friendlier younger sister app of OverDrive, which remains a rather clunky and uninviting way to get library titles onto a device such as your iPhone ($999 at Sprint), Android or Kindle reader. A help area called Libby Academy is useful for navigating around the app, but a simple, animated design makes it easier and more intuitive to use than OverDrive even right off the bat. In the Libby app on iPhone or Android, tap the icon in the upper right corner for the main menu. There, you can add your library card number if you have one, or discover how to get one in your area. Some library systems allow for obtaining a library card online, while others don't. In San Francisco, for example, you can fill out a form online or within the app, but you'll have to pick up the library card in person at one of the city's branches within 30 days. Choose Set Up Libby within the main menu in order to choose download behavior (i.e. whether you want to automatically download everything, nothing or titles under 20 megabytes), select your preferred reading devices or, after you've started the borrowing process, to edit the titles you have on hold. While browsing, you'll be able to read samples of the e-books and play samples of the audiobooks, as well as borrow the title if it's available or reserve it if there's a waiting list. If the title is available to rent, you'll be able to tap Borrow, learn how long the rental period is and confirm that you still want it. Once you've successfully borrowed the book, you'll be given the option to read it via the app or with Kindle. If you choose Kindle, you'll be taken to Amazon's website, where you'll finalize borrowing the book and sending wirelessly to your device. Tap Shelf on the lower right corner of the app's homepage. Tap Loans, then Manage Loan(s), which will allow you to renew the book if possible, return the loan to the library or send to a device. As is the case with OverDrive, the catalog of titles you see in Libby as well as the amount of copies available to borrow (even as a download) are determined by your library, so you might need to add yourself to the waiting list by tapping Place Hold within the specific book's page. If you do this, you'll be shown how many copies are circulating, how many people are waiting and how long your wait will be. And sometimes those waits are long -- for example, if I wanted to check out Kevin Kwan's Crazy Rich Asians from the San Francisco Public Library as I write this, I'd have to wait for nine weeks. Also keep in mind that your library's rental period might be one to three weeks, which means you might need to be prepared to read or listen to it pretty much right away when it's your turn.

The update, which is now available to iPhone and iPad users, should also fix issues related to iPad keyboards, video subtitles and Bluetooth reliability. Apple had pledged last week to fix the charging issue, which kept some devices from charging while they were ""asleep,"" with a future software update. Some users had also complained about reception issues when transitioning between Wi-Fi networks and cellular services.

CNET,Apple Watch Series 4 reportedly had some trouble with daylight saving time,10/08/18,https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-watch-series-4-reportedly-had-some-trouble-with-daylight-saving-time/," Apple Watch Series 4 users in Australia reported problems on Sunday. Apple's latest Watch had some trouble Sunday with daylight saving time in Australia, reports say. Owners of the Apple Watch Series 4 posted on Reddit about their Watches getting stuck in reboot loops -- leaving them unable to charge up or restart the devices -- due to the country entering daylight saving time and losing an hour. The problems ended when Monday rolled around and the devices entered a normal 24-hour day, 9to5Mac reported. Apple didn't immediately respond a request for comment. Users who encountered the problem suspect it was tied to the Activity ""complication"" -- Apple's term for information shown on the watch face -- when using the Infograph Modular face option. That draws a timeline graph of the current day based on hour by hour data. Users reckon the 23-hour day Sunday caused the Watch to crash and reboot. Some figured out a workaround that involved removing the Infograph Modular face using the Watch's companion app on iPhone, and noted that they could use it as normal on Monday. It seems likely that Apple will need to patch this issue before daylight saving time ends in Europe on Sunday, Oct. 28 and in the US on Sunday, Nov. 4. Those regions end daylight savings time around the time Australia's begins it because their seasons are opposite. Millions of Europeans voted over the summer to end the biannual time changes, saying they favored keeping the time used in summer for the whole year.

CNET,T-Mobile's enhanced LTE network gets its first tablet,10/08/18,https://www.cnet.com/news/t-mobiles-enhanced-lte-network-gets-its-first-tablet/," The 8-inch 3T 8 tablet will stream video for 7 hours on T-Mobile's LTE network. As T-Mobile's 600 MHz spectrum LTE network continues to grow, we're finally seeing devices made to take advantage of its enhanced coverage. The 8-inch 3T 8 from Alcatel will be the network's first to access the 600 MHz spectrum, which delivers better indoor coverage across a large geographic stretch. Powered by a 4080mAh battery, Alcatel claims up to 7 hours of constant video streaming on high-speed LTE or 8.5 over Wi-Fi. Running on Android 8.1  Oreo, the tablet has a 1280x800-resolution touch display, 2GB of memory and 16GB of storage with a quad-core 1.5GHz MediaTek MT8765A processor. Included is a new CloserTV app giving users a ""one-stop  shop  for  video  streaming  and  live  TV  on  your  tablet"" as well as a  built-in  Kids  Mode with a parental  control  panel for setting app access and time limits. ""T-Mobile already has 600 MHz LTE deployed in more than 1,250 cities and towns across 36 states, including Puerto Rico,"" a spokeswoman for the carrier said in a statement to CNET. To speed the process of freeing up the spectrum for LTE, T-Mobile is working with broadcasters currently on the 600 MHz spectrum to assist them in moving to new frequencies. These spectrum repacks enhance LTE coverage and capacity with equipment that is also 5G ready. The Alcatel 3T 8 will be available in T-Mobile stores and online starting Oct. 12 for $6 down and $6 a month for 24 months or $150. First published Oct. 8, 10:56 a.m. ET.

The service, rebranded from MetroPCS, launched with new plans on Monday. But the company also said at an event at Grand Central Terminal in New York that it's committing to offering 5G for Metro next year. ""When we talk about 5G for all, it's not just nationwide 5G service, but it's all shades of T-Mobile, magenta and purple,"" said Neville Ray, chief technology officer at T-Mobile. Metro's branding revolves around purple 5G is the all the rage in the wireless industry as carriers hype the capabilities that come with a faster, more responsive network. It has the potential to power other technologies like self-driving cars and the internet of things, once it actually gets turned on. While there are some 5G deployments this year, customers will more likely get a chance to experience it next year with broader deployment. T-Mobile has committed to launching 5G service in 30 cities next year. Metro customers will also get access to 5G in those areas as well. Bringing 5G to prepaid so quickly is a break from industry convention. When 4G LTE and WiMax were new, they were kept to the core national carriers to maintain that premium feature feel. It wasn't until the networks were more fully deployed that 4G capabilities trickled down to prepaid services, which generally cater to customers with low or no credit scores. But T-Mobile is in the middle of rebranding its Metro by T-Mobile service to more closely align it with its parent. Metro launched new unlimited data plans on Monday, with some tiers offering Google One cloud storage and Amazon Prime membership.

CNET,"For Magic Leap to be truly magical, it needs content, content, content",10/08/18,https://www.cnet.com/news/for-magic-leap-to-be-truly-magical-it-needs-content-content-content/," Magic Leap, one of the most talked-about, overhyped startups in the tech industry, reached a major milestone this summer when it released its mixed reality headset to developers after years of promises. Now CEO Rony Abovitz and his team are working to convince developers and creative types who've paid $2,295 for the first-generation Magic Leap One ""Creator Edition"" to invest in its platform. And that means creating enough cool games, apps and interactive experiences so that when Magic Leap finally delivers a consumer version of its steampunk-inspired headset, sometime in the hopefully not-too-distant future, we'll want to buy it. Which is why Magic Leap is holding its first public developer conference, called LEAP (""Learn, Engage, Accelerate, Program"") this week in Los Angeles. The Magic Leap One headset. Abovitz and his team need to inspire his developers and partners, to show them that his device is worth spending their time, energy and money on. Without that creative energy, and the apps that come with it, Magic Leap cannot deliver on the promise of the world-changing technology that everyone, from venture capitalists to tech futurists to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, says is coming. The pitch is there's a new wave of technology that will be as much a revelation as the early internet and the first Apple iPhone were in their times. These new headsets, which can either immerse you in a computer-generated world or overlay computer information on the real world we live in, will change the way we interact with computers, ourselves and everything else. These technologies, Zuckerberg wrote in 2014, were  ""once the dream of science fiction."" But so were the internet, computers and smartphones, he said. ""The future is coming and we have a chance to build it together."" If you believe that promise, then Magic Leap is one of the most important companies out there. Which explains why it's raised over $2.3 billion from backers including Google and AT&T. A few weeks before the headset unveiling, CNET was invited to Magic Leap's headquarters in Plantation, Florida, to talk to Abovitz and other top executives, try its gear, see the in-house factory where it manufactures the optics it claims puts the magic in its system and hear about its development and content ambitions. And we heard how its developer conference, which will comprise hundreds of invite-only devotees and potential partners, is the start of what Abovitz calls the kickoff to a ""Magical Mystery Tour."" Over the next year, it'll include developer roadshows all over the country and ""consumer experiential"" events where people can try on the headset for themselves. ""I kind of feel like Magic Leap is a band that has to go play a bunch of smaller clubs, prove our worth to everybody,"" Abovitz said in a July interview. ""We're just going to get out there and play to one person in the crowd if we have to, and just be the hardest-working band and just keep doing that for the next 18 months or so."" If you buy a Magic Leap system today, you get a headset, called Lightwear, that weighs less than a pound and looks like it came out of sci-fi flick. It's an oval-shaped ring thats sits like a crown on your head to distribute the weight and that puts its  round lenses, with cameras on either side, right in front of your eyes. The tech built into those lenses is attached by a wire to the small disc-shaped computer called Lightpack, which straddles your pocket and has enough computing power to generate realistic-looking 3D images of real and fictional characters and scenes that are then overlaid onto the real world. That means you could be sitting at home while your kids play and also be reading an email or watching a baseball game in the corner of your living room, on a screen you can see in your glasses but that isn't there in the real world. You navigate through that world and experiences with a remote control that Magic Leap calls Control. This mashup of the real and virtual worlds is called ""augmented reality"" (AR) or ""mixed reality"" (MR).  And it's different from  virtual reality (VR), which completely immerses you in a computer-generated world. While techies are excited about MR, it has the same content problems VR does. In particular, there's very little you can do with it. There aren't many MR apps or games, and there certainly isn't a ""killer app,"" an experience that gets everyone buzzing that they just have to try it. If you put a Magic Leap One headset on right now, you'll get a few demonstrations cooked up by the company, including the painting and Lego-like building program Project Create and others created by the company's enthusiastic early supporters. What you won't find is a thriving ecosystem of apps like what's available on the PC, the Mac, the iPhone and Android-powered devices. At least, not yet. But it's those apps, experts say, that are going to be what convinces us that these VR and AR devices may someday be worth caring about. Magic Leap promises to overlay computer images on the real world. Kinda like Pokemon Go, but in a headset. ""It's going to take time,"" said James Iliff, the co-founder and creative director at Survios, a company that makes virtual reality games like the movie-inspired boxing title Creed: Rise To Glory. Magic Leap and other headsets, including Microsoft's $5,000 HoloLens and Facebook's $399 Oculus Rift VR headset, are still in their early days in terms of user adoption, with some analysts estimating that fewer than 9 million headsets will be sold this year. (Magic Leap declined to share sales figures.) A key reason everyday people haven't bought in yet is there's just not enough compelling applications and content. That's why Iliff thinks Magic Leap needs to inspire developers to invest time, money and energy into building apps for its device. And it's probably why Magic Leap has partnered with groups like the Royal Shakespeare Co., the NBA and Star Wars maker Lucasfilm, which aims to create experiences inspired by the popular space drama. ""All that matters for Magic Leap is they get their hardware into the hands of developers and start getting stuff being made,"" Iliff said. That's Abovitz's plan too. ""We know we have to prove to everybody why we have a reason for being,"" he said, talking about the reason for hosting the developer conference and the following roadshows. ""We want you to have a great experience, to have something happen that was amazing, and to learn about that. And then either become a fan now, or if you're a creator, it's like, 'Let me get my hands on and start building it.'"" Since its release in August, the Magic Leap One has gotten cautiously optimistic reviews. ""Whether it's more than a developer prototype, and whether it amazes you, is another story,"" CNET reviewer Scott Stein wrote after trying the Magic Leap headset shortly before it went on sale. Some industry insiders have praised Magic Leap's design. The experience is the best of its kind that he's tried so far, but it needs to wow. It's ""a step forward, but not a game changer. Not yet, at least,"" Stein wrote. ""It all depends on what comes next."" Complicating it all is that Magic Leap built up a lot of hype in the tech world before even before showing off its first prototypes publicly. Some developers and industry watchers told me that hype may have made it hard for the company to deliver the magic what we're all expecting in its first release. ""It has to be something where you go 'wow,' but want to go back to it too,"" said Mike Bloxham, an analyst at research firm Frank N. Magid Associates.  ""If people's heightened expectations of the device aren't met, they're going to turn away from it and say it's not worth the hype or money."" Magic Leap has won over a few people already, like Travis Falstad, development director of MR and VR at RelayCars, which lets you virtually get behind the wheel of all sorts of cars. When he first tried Magic Leap, Falstad was inspired in a way he hadn't been with other devices. Part of it was the included controller that acts like a wand, which you can swing and tap on to interact with what Magic Leap shows you (others require that you make gestures with your hands in order to work). The Magic Leap controller gave Falstad and his team the idea to build a mini-car racing game using the images they'd already created for VR experiences. ""We think car sales will change a lot in the next 10 to 20 years,"" he said, citing anecdotes that people are reluctant to go to dealerships and increasingly are doing car research at home first. He's not under the illusion that a game like his will suddenly catch fire among the people who've bought Magic Leap devices so far this year. But like other developers before him, Falstad's betting that devices like Magic Leap One or HoloLens will catch on, eventually. ""We're making that investment with the strong hope that it applies to these future platforms,"" he said. For Abovitz, 2018 and beyond is all about winning the support of more developers like Falstad. We asked him in July what success looks like for the company in the near term. He says it's about moving the company past the hype and getting content, content, content. ""2018 is we have gotten our creator community that was behind the scenes and the one in public activated,"" Abovitz said. ""We do our LEAP conference, and people start to make a lot of cool stuff. We get to share a lot of cool stuff, and the entire conversation of ""Is it real?"" is completely gone."" CNET's Connie Guglielmo and Scott Stein contributed to this report.

CNET,"The Honor 8X is like a super-cheap iPhone XS Max, in all the best ways",10/08/18,https://www.cnet.com/reviews/huawei-honor-8x-preview/," The Honor 8X is a good-looking budget phone. Huawei knows that not everyone can afford a $1,000 phone, or would want to spend that much even if they could. So the new Honor 8X gives you all the iPhone XS Max's ($1,257 at Amazon Marketplace) screen size and extra glitz for a budget price. The new Honor 8X sports a 6.5-inch, bezel-less, notched display and a shiny metallic look in blue, black or red (I saw it in blue). Even though it sells for 1,399 yuan in China -- that converts to about $205, £155 or AU$285 -- it doesn't feel like a budget phone. Its specs and overall look and feel pack a punch. Phones by Huawei and its Honor sub-brand won't sell in the US, given the US government's stance on the Chinese company's products. But that exclusion hasn't hurt Huawei so far. On the contrary, the Chinese brand's sales have surged to make it the world's second largest phone-maker, behind Samsung, knocking Apple (the most profitable phone-maker) into third. If the Honor 8X's design looks familiar, you may recall the Huawei Nova 3i ($316 at Amazon), which has a similar design, though it has a slightly smaller display at 6.3 inches. For those who think a 6.5-inch screen isn't enough, there's also a bigger version, the Honor 8X Max, which has a whopping 7.1-inch panel. Inside, there's a Kirin 710 processor for the 8X, while the 8X Max uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 636 processor. While I didn't get a chance to try out the larger Max, the 8X's Kirin 710 doesn't feel sluggish at all in the short amount of time I got to try out the phone. I liked how the phone feels in my hand, and while the 6.5-inch screen may seem large, the phone's about the same size as the iPhone 8 Plus ($699 at Walmart). When placed side by side, the amount of display really stands out. As with recent Huawei-made phones, the Honor 8X's dual cameras are AI-powered. Turn on AI mode and the camera will automatically detect what sort of shots it should take, for example, closeups of objects, or switching automatically to portrait mode if it sees a face. The camera offers Huawei's standard suite of features, including AI shot detection and a night mode that combines multiple shots into one image. It also has a night mode, which combines multiple exposure shots into one image. There does seem to be some noise tradeoff, but the images are slightly clearer, with a little more detail compared to the standard photo mode. The Honor 8X looks like a compelling choice for those wanting a cheap phone without compromising on quality or performance. It'll be sold in Asia and Europe."
CNET,Spotify vs. Apple Music: Which is right for you?,10/07/18,https://www.cnet.com/news/spotify-vs-apple-music-which-is-the-best-music-service-compared-comparison/," So many streaming services, so little time. If you're tossing up between the benefits of Spotify over Apple Music, or vice versa, you'll want to know as much about each as possible before making your choice. Which is the best for iPhone or Android owners? Which has the most support for all sorts of smart speakers? And which has the most perks for subscribers? Of course, Apple Music and Spotify aren't the only ones to choose from. In the US there are at least six major platforms to choose from, including YouTube Music, Google Play Music, Amazon Music and Tidal. Some have bigger catalogs than the others, or offer bundle deals to get music streaming as part of another package. But here's how the big two compare for streaming music. Both Spotify and Apple Music offer a free trial period for their premium services, which normally cost $10, £10 or AU$12 a month. It costs $5 for students or $15 for family plans. With the premium version, you can stream any song from the catalog on demand, plus listen to songs offline. Spotify is the only one that also has a free, ad-supported tier, so even if you don't want to pay for the premium version you can still listen. But many albums and playlists require you to listen in shuffle mode rather than sequential play and there's a limit of six skips per hour. Apple Music only lets free users stream Beats1 Radio, or you can listen to songs from your iTunes library. Winner: Spotify The free version of Spotify lets you listen to songs on demand, but many playlists and albums can only be listened to on shuffle. In terms of stream quality, Spotify uses the Ogg Vorbis format. On mobile you can choose what bitrate to stream, in increments up to 320kbps, which is handy especially if you're worried about using up too much mobile data. Desktop playback is at 160kbps or 320kbps for premium users. If you listen on Spotify's web player or via Chromecast, it streams in AAC at 128kbps for free users or 256kbps for premium. Apple Music streams 256kbps AAC files. To find out more about bitrate and audio quality, read this in-depth comparison of sound quality between Apple Music and Spotify. You can also adjust the equalizer in both to suit your preferences (although you'll find Apple Music's EQ setting outside of the app, within the Settings > Music section on the iPhone). Unless you're a serious audiophile, you probably won't notice much difference between the highest-quality Spotify and Apple Music streams of the same song. If the highest audio fidelity is really important to you, consider another service that supports lossless streaming like Tidal. Winner: draw Apple Music has a larger library for tunes, topping 45 million vs. Spotify's 35 million. Both offer early access to certain albums from time to time and Apple Music sometimes offers exclusives for certain music videos. On top of music, Spotify has a dedicated podcast section. Both also let you watch music videos and if you like something you hear in Apple Music, you can always buy the song or video direct through the iTunes Store. If you turn on iCloud Music Library within Apple Music, you can access your personal library of tunes across all your devices (from the PC to the phone). This feature ""matches"" songs in your library with those in the iTunes catalog, or uploads them if the song isn't available, so you can listen to your music wherever you're signed in with your Apple ID. You can store up to 100,000 songs. Note that iTunes Match is also available even without an Apple Music subscription for $25 a year. Spotify also lets you play music from your device in the Spotify app, but it only works for local files (so they aren't stored in the cloud). Winner: Apple Music Apple Music features a clean white look on mobile, while Spotify paints it black across its apps. Both are pretty easy to navigate on mobile, with the main tabs (radio, search, your library and so on) found at the bottom of the interface. Depending on the song, Spotify has animations and short videos that play full screen while you're listening. Both let you look at lyrics on screen if they're available for particular songs. But only Apple Music lets you search by typing a stream of lyrics to find songs you don't know the name of. Google Maps lets you listen to and control Spotify or Apple Music playback within the navigation interface in iOS and Android. Waze also offers a similar feature for Spotify users. On top of CarPlay support, Apple Music for Android now works with Android Auto, so you can control playback through the infotainment system. Winner: draw Both Apple Music and Spotify are available on iOS and Android. Both have a standalone desktop apps for Windows and Mac, so you aren't limited to listening on mobile. In the case of Apple Music, that's iTunes. Spotify Connect lets you Cast to compatible devices and listen on AirPlay speakers (on iOS only). You can also listen to music in your browser: Spotify is at open.spotify.com. But Apple Music it isn't technically a full web player, it's more of a web widget at tools.applemusic.com. And you can also stream any audio to a Bluetooth wireless speaker, to an AirPlay speaker from an iOS device, or to a Chromecast speaker from an Android device (you can also cast from iOS if you have Spotify). When it comes to smart speakers that support services natively -- with voice control, and without a source device -- it's a totally different story. Apple Music with Siri voice control is limited to the HomePod. Apple Music is also available on other Apple devices like the Apple Watch and Apple TV. Spotify, meanwhile, is available on Amazon Alexa speakers and Google smart speakers. And, if a device is certified as Spotify Connect compatible, it means you can use the Spotify app as a remote to control playback. Spotify is also available across a wide range of other devices like Xbox and PlayStation. Winner: Spotify Beats1 Radio. One of the top reasons to use a streaming service is to discover new music. Both Spotify and Apple Music expose you to new tunes based on what you already like. Spotify has tailored playlists like Discover Weekly and Release Radar that are automatically populated each week with new songs. Apple Music has similar playlists, including New Music Mix. When you first sign up for each service, both ask you for your favorite genres and artists to get a baseline reading. Once you start listening more, each gets a clearer picture of your likes and dislikes to help tailor recommendations even further. Spotify and Apple Music also have radio stations based around your favorite artists, tracks or genres. Apple Music also has a separate station called Beats1 Radio which is curated and hosted by actual DJs, so you can listen to it in real time like you would a traditional radio station. In our experience, Spotify's algorithmic recommendations for new music based on our listening habits is the most on-point. But Apple Music's human-curated radio station often uncovers new or unreleased tracks that also appeal. Winner: Spotify Spotify codes can be scanned with the camera to share playlists. Both services let you follow your favorite artists to keep up to date with their posts and latest releases. You can also follow friends. On Spotify, you can see what song your pals are listening to in real-time (if they choose to share this detail) on the desktop app. Spotify Codes are a way to share tracks, albums and playlists among friends. It's kind of like a custom QR code that you can scan with the camera in Spotify if you're listening in the same location, or share through messages if you're apart. Many popular musicians seem to be more active in posting updates on Apple Music and it's easier to find that content than it is on Spotify. Naturally, you can also follow your friends and see what they're up to across both platforms. While it's much easier to find profiles on Apple Music than it is on Spotify, you do have to already have your friends in your contacts list (or on Facebook) to follow them. Winner: Apple Music If you want a free service, Spotify is the clear winner. But if you are looking to pay for a service, your decision may be a little more complicated. Apple Music plays well with other Apple devices. If you want voice control on the HomePod, for example, Apple Music is your only option. Spotify, on the other hand, has greater cross-compatibility across lots of different devices, from game consoles to smart speakers. It takes time to train each of these services to really get to know your taste. For our money, Spotify does a better job in uncovering and tailoring playlists and recommendations to us through its custom playlists and discovery features. But Apple Music gives you the most flexibility in mixing songs from your own library (that might not even be on streaming services) with new tunes you can stream on demand.

CNET,"OnePlus 6T: Removing the headphone jack was a tough decision, says CEO",10/07/18,https://www.cnet.com/news/oneplus-6t-removing-the-headphone-jack-was-a-tough-decision/," OnePlus CEO and founder, Pete Lau. Speaking in his native Mandarin, OnePlus' founder and CEO Pete Lau exudes a reserved persona, despite being only weeks away from unveiling the OnePlus 6T phone. Compared to the company's other founder, Carl Pei, Lau carries himself more formally. Though the two look unassuming in their own ways, Pei is often seen wearing cotton tees and clapping back on Twitter about free phone handouts and false product rumors. Meanwhile Lau, who is 14 years Pei's senior, mostly tweets about OnePlus industry news. It's this calm demeanor that betrays his nervousness inside -- something you wouldn't notice until Lau explicitly mentioned it when asked about the launch. ""My feelings are, to best summarize, complex,"" said Lau through an interpreter. ""It's a mix of both excitement and anxiety."" Donning a black button-up and bespeckled navy blazer, he goes on to compare his feelings to when your own child is about to be born. Though the OnePlus 6T isn't out yet, we already know a fair bit about the upcoming phone. And unlike the previous years of ""T-devices"" (which are seen as half-step updates to the counterpart phones before it, like the OnePlus 3T over the 3), the OnePlus 6T is shaping up to be dramatically different than its OnePlus 6 predecessor. For starters, the phone may finally achieve mainstream recognition in the US by launching with T-Mobile, which is the company's first US carrier deal. It also won't have a headphone jack -- a possibly contentious move for Android users, who have fewer and fewer options for marquee phones that have headphone ports. Finally, the OnePlus 6T beats out two established players, Apple and Samsung, by delivering an in-screen fingerprint sensor to a wide US audience. Add on the fact that OnePlus is launching in October -- a month earlier than usual -- and it's easy to understand why Lau's feeling eager. Lau plays a hands-on role in the development of OnePlus's products. He's an engineer at heart, having worked at the Chinese device maker Oppo for 15 years. (Oppo and OnePlus share the same parent company, BBK Electronics.) But as the CEO of OnePlus since founding it in 2013, he sees himself as the product manager of all product managers at the company. He knows he has to make the tough calls. That includes following a trend popularized first by Apple and later Google in lopping off the headphone jack on the 6T. ""This has been one of the most difficult decisions for us to make,"" said Lau. ""The most difficult task in the day-to-day is… finding a balance in what's ultimately going to be part of the end product and what has to be said 'No' to."" Informal Twitter polls from OnePlus in 2016, 2017 and 2018 asking if users like headphone jacks on their phones. One of the reasons OnePlus cut the headphone jack was to make room for the in-screen fingerprint sensor, which the company brands as Screen Unlock. By replacing the physical sensor on the back of the phone to under the screen, the fingerprint reader takes up essential space inside, near the bottom of the phone. It's also banking on its customers' use of Bluetooth headphones. After conducting a user survey, it found that 59 percent of respondents already used wireless headphones to listen to music and place calls. And for the first time since June 2016, sales of Bluetooth headphones overtook non-Bluetooth headphones in the US, according to analyst firm NPD. ""Consumers miss the 3.5mm jack when they're gone,"" said GlobalData research director Avi Greengart, ""but Apple has shown that having them is not a primary purchase driver."" By releasing its own Bluetooth earbuds earlier this year called Bullets Wireless, OnePlus set the stage for shifting 6T owners over to wireless headphones. So far, things are looking good -- within minutes, Bullets Wireless sold out in some regions. Still, Lau knows that the move will be controversial, especially since plenty of people still use wired headphones. Wired headphones give you more options to shop from, they're cheaper, they don't require a charge and they don't run into connectivity issues. Last year, a Yahoo Finance survey reported that 73 percent of Android users said they wouldn't switch to an iPhone because of its lack of a headphone port. It also didn't help that Carl Pei conducted casual Twitter polls to show how much OnePlus listened to user feedback. Most of his respondents preferred to keep the headphone jack. To those who are upset that the OnePlus 6T won't have a jack, Lau believes the tradeoffs are worth it. ""After you experience the Screen Unlock you'll fall in love with it,"" he said. ""[You'll] realize that it's the experience that you wanted."" Fingerprint-on-display sensors (or FOD) on phones are a rare find in the US. Right now, they're available on Vivo phones (the Vivo V11, X20 Plus UD, X21 and Nex) a couple of Oppo phones (Oppo R17 and R17 Pro), the Xiaomi Mi 8 Explorer Edition and the Porsche Design Huawei Mate RS. But soon, users in the US and elsewhere will have the feature on the OnePlus 6T -- edging out both Apple and Samsung who are both rumored to include this technology in their future phones. In addition to streamlining the OnePlus 6T's design, FOD eliminates the need to pick up the phone to unlock the screen. ""We unlock our phones multiple times a day, and Screen Unlock reduces the number of steps to complete the action,"" said a OnePlus engineer in a prior interview with CNET. ""By adding this feature as an addition to other display unlocking options such as Face Unlock, users will have options to unlock the display in a way that is most efficient for them."" A OnePlus 5T with early-stage prototype software for the under-screen fingerprint reader. Despite being known as ""in-screen fingerprint readers"" the technology is actually embedded underneath displays. When you touch the designated area of the screen with your finger, a sensor array turns on the display to light your finger. Your fingerprint is then read by an optical image sensor and an AI processor. If the print matches, the screen unlocks. Originally, last year's OnePlus 5T was supposed to have FOD. But it didn't work as fast or as efficiently as the company wanted, and the feature was delayed until the 6T. Along with OnePlus' implementation, Lau believes the phone industry will continue in this direction, similar to how onscreen notches caught on within a few years. There are a few downsides to this fad though. Not only did OnePlus eliminate 6T's headphone jack because of the FOD, it also made the phone 0.45mm thicker. The feature also bumped up the overall cost of the phone. There's no official price out yet, but earlier reports tentatively put it at $550 -- or $21 more than the OnePlus 6. ""Screen Unlock technology is something very new and there's a definite cost required for that new technology,"" said Lau. ""It's not cheap."" Since it launched the first OnePlus One in 2014, OnePlus was known for offering phones with premium specs at a wallet-friendly price. But the company is dealing with the dilemma of serving up similar features that iPhones and Galaxy S-devices offer, while keeping prices low. And compared to other brands, OnePlus has one of the highest increases in cost from model to model (the expected $21 price increase of the 6T is yet another addition to the steady climb of prices). Meanwhile, rival companies are incorporating cutting-edge technology into their phones at a neck breaking pace. Apple, Samsung and LG  for instance, have phones with wireless charging. But OnePlus' signature fast-charging technology, known as Dash Charging, is a fan-favorite feature. In order for OnePlus to release a phone with wireless charging, the device would have to charge as quickly as what users are accustomed to with Dash Charging. That means the phone would have to be thicker and it would conduct a lot of heat. ""We're working hard on this,"" said Lau. ""When we get to the day that the wireless charging can get up to speed without the implication of heat that we expect, then I believe we can integrate the technology."" Many competitors, including Google, also certify their phones with an IP rating for water resistance. But to Lau -- who says the OnePlus 6T is more water resistant than any of its predecessors and can survive an accidental drop in the sink or a splash during a rainstorm -- the cost to go through official IP certification just isn't worth it. ""The number of users that are taking their phone to go swimming are few and far between,"" said Lau. To have everyone else pay, say, $30 more, ""for the sake of an IP rating"" in order to accommodate the one user who goes off and swims with their phone is ""unreasonable,"" according to Lau. Incorporating these new features, which Lau isn't necessarily ruling out, all goes back to increasing prices. Though he insists that prices don't dictate the end product, and that giving people the latest and greatest in tech is the company's main priority, it's clear that OnePlus would lose its luster as the scrappy darling of the Android phone world if its prices were on par with its rivals. ""As flagship phones from Apple, Samsung and Huawei are all topping the $1,000 price point,"" said Greengart, ""OnePlus has a real opportunity to package leading edge technology at a lower price point."" For now, OnePlus is still mainly an internet-centric, direct-to-consumers online retailer, which helps keep costs low. In addition, a possible $550 price tag would still put it at around $100 to $450 cheaper than the iPhone XS, the Galaxy Note 9 and the Pixel 2. Lau also doesn't appear too worried about any outcry over the OnePlus 6T's price either. He's more jazzed about users' reactions to the fingerprint scanner. And while he's no stranger to public events, his products launches are still cause for anxiety. ""The most difficult thing right now,"" said Lau, ""is that the teams are expecting [me] to memorize English."" OnePlus confirms: The 6T will have an in-screen fingerprint sensor. OnePlus 6T: Six features we're dying to see."
CNET,Why your iPhone XS selfies look different,10/07/18,https://www.cnet.com/news/iphone-xs-beauty-gate-heres-why-selfies-look-different/," If you've taken a selfie on the iPhone XS, you might think it looks a little different to other selfies you've taken in the past, especially from previous iPhones. We already know the cameras on the iPhone XS are different from those on the X. But some users on Reddit and YouTube have claimed that the camera on the iPhone XS has a ""beauty mode"" effect on faces that smooths imperfections. Several apps like Snapchat, Instagram and FaceTune actively offer filters that enhance or retouch facial features. Here's why selfies look different on the XS, but not for the reason you might think. If you're taking photos of a high-contrast scene, it's hard for a camera sensor to capture all the detail in highlights and shadows. Think of a photo taken from indoors, looking out to a window with lots of light streaming in from the outside. Most cameras end up exposing for either the indoor light (which means the window light blows out completely) or the outside light (meaning the indoor scene is dark and underexposed). One solution is high dynamic range (HDR) images. HDR blends multiple exposures -- usually an underexposed, overexposed and correctly metered photo -- into one. This helps capture a greater dynamic range in photos, so shadow and highlight detail is evened out. Take this photo from the iPhone XS with HDR on (left) and off (right) and notice the extra detail retained in the window. Without HDR, phone cameras can struggle to expose for both shadow and highlight detail, so you often end up with blown highlights or muddy-looking shadows. Many photographers have used HDR techniques to achieve what can look like ""hyper-real"" photos. With the right kind of processing, at the most extreme end of the scale photos can look overly saturated and almost like they're illustrations, or airbrushed versions of reality. Apple's version of HDR on the iPhone XS, XS Max and the forthcoming iPhone XR, is called Smart HDR. It's on by default for photos taken on both the front and rear cameras. (FYI if you want to turn it off, go to Settings > Camera.) At Apple's iPhone XS launch, Phil Schiller used an example of a photo taken of a moving subject to explain how Smart HDR works. The A12 Bionic chip first captures four frames as buffer, then takes additional ""inter frames"" at different exposures to bring out highlight details. It also takes a long exposure to grab shadow detail. Then, all the frames are analyzed and it works out how to merge the best parts into one photo. A selfie taken on the XS (left) and X (right) in outdoor light. Even without Smart HDR active, the XS photo looks more balanced and with an even spread between shadows and highlights compared to the photo from the X. Also notice there's no loss of detail or ""smoothing"" effect on the skin on the XS image. With Smart HDR turned on, the XS generates a blended image. But even without Smart HDR turned on, the XS is already using computational photography to merge exposures, perform local tone mapping (a technique to map colors to achieve an HDR effect) and recover highlight detail on regular photos. It's also important to note that merging multiple exposures and blending images isn't unique to Apple. Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy phones do similar things in their own HDR modes. Two things. You might think that an HDR image looks ""airbrushed,"" particularly when comparing it to a photo taken on a phone that doesn't have HDR turned on. Take, for example, the portrait below taken on the rear cameras of both the iPhone XS (left) and iPhone X (right). The XS image may look softer to you because the glowing highlights have been reduced, thanks to blending exposures and less contrast. Secondly, to make an HDR image, you need at least three images taken at the same time. Unless you hold the phone incredibly steady or ask your subject to hold their expression (try that with kids), you'll likely introduce some sort of shake. The way to get around this is to have the camera take photos at incredibly fast shutter speeds. But to get a good exposure at a fast shutter speed of hundredths of a second, especially in low light, the camera needs to crank up the ISO (light sensitivity). This introduces a lot of noise, which can look like speckles, or grain on your photos. It's only magnified by having a small sensor like that found on a front-facing camera. Cameras often apply noise reduction to get rid of this noise, but the tradeoff is photos can look smoothed out. Below is an example of a photo taken on a DSLR in low light at ISO 3200, with a lot of noise (left). On the right, the same photo with heavy noise reduction applied in Lightroom. As you can see, the image on the right looks a lot smoother and loses some detail. It's an extreme example, but gives you an idea of what noise reduction can do. Here's an important caveat with the iPhone XS: if you're taking selfies or photos from the front-facing camera in good lighting, the camera doesn't appear to apply much noise reduction at all, at least from my tests. In low light, the noise reduction seems to be more aggressive, hence a smoothing effect. Spot the difference: iPhone X on left, XS on right. Both photos were taken indoors in low light. And it's not just faces where this applies -- If you look at photos taken of other subjects in low light, especially with the front-facing camera, you may notice the same effect. Sebastiaan de With, designer of popular third-party camera app Halide, explains the changes in the XS camera in this piece. One important conclusion to glean from his deep dive is this: ""The iPhone XS merges exposures and reduces the brightness of the bright areas and reduces the darkness of the shadows. The detail remains, but we can perceive it as less sharp because it lost local contrast."" Since iOS 10, iPhones have been able to capture raw images from the rear camera. Raw files are photos captured straight from the image sensor without processing applied. This means no HDR effects, no noise reduction and an untouched image. However, de With found that if you're shooting in raw on the XS, the sensor noise is stronger than it was on the X, so the noise reduction is more aggressive. Third-party apps will need to optimize specifically for the new camera, or users will need to shoot in manual mode and deliberately underexpose. One way that this effect could potentially be tweaked is with a software update to offer different levels of Smart HDR, or to reduce the intensity of the noise-reduction algorithm for all photos. Turning off Smart HDR makes more of a difference for photos taken with the rear camera than it does the front camera. And as already discussed, the XS camera is taking photos in a different way than earlier iPhones, through computational photography and merging exposures. So photos already look different, even without Smart HDR on. But a big part of this entire discussion is how we see photos differently -- especially of ourselves. Many people I showed selfies to preferred the XS because their photos looked more even and slightly softer. Others deferred to the X because it appeared to retain more detail to their eye, even if the image had more noise. As always, your personal preference may sway one way or the other. But neither image is wrong: they're just different. iPhone XS review: A notch above the iPhone X iPhone XS specs vs. XS Max, XR, X: What's new and different"
CNET,Fitbit Charge 3 has arrived: Here's what's different vs. Versa,10/07/18,https://www.cnet.com/news/fitbit-charge-3-heres-whats-different-vs-versa/," The newest Fitbit gets a little more smartwatchy, but stays slim. Sliding into an October already full of watches and wearables, the Fitbit Charge 3 -- which hits stores today, starting at $149 (£130, AU$230) -- promises to be the company's best general fitness tracker. And yet: Fitbit already has a watch, the Fitbit Versa, that does a lot of the same things (and a bit more) for just $50 more. Confused? Don't worry, I'm here to help. I've only been wearing the Charge 3 for a couple of days, and a full review is coming. But here's what I can tell you in the meantime, based on my early experience so far. Optional woven nylon band attached. It's a comfy, basic-feeling fitness band. Unlike larger-screened watches, the Fitbit Charge 3 keeps to a thinner, vertical-screened look, just like its predecessor. The included rubber band feels super comfortable and comes in two sizes out of the box. Additional bands include a woven nylon one -- not bad, but I didn't like it as much as the Versa's woven watch band -- and a perforated rubber sports band, which is quite comfortable. I didn't try the Horween leather bands, because I wouldn't wear leather bands with a waterproof fitness tracker anyway. The larger display and touchscreen make a difference. The larger grayscale OLED is crisp and easier to read, and shows more text for messages. The true touchscreen finally allows swiping between different app functions, or swiping up or down for notifications and fitness stats. The side pressure-sensitive haptic button is really nice, and vibrations are strong. Instead of a physical button, you squeeze an indented area of the steel case to quickly access settings, or pause or stop workouts. The vibrations feel stronger than previous Charge trackers. Fitbit Versa (left) versus Fitbit Charge 3 (right). Many similar features, but key differences. Navigation is a little weird, though. Swiping to features like the timer, alarms, the breathe-relax mode, or even starting a workout feels like a lot of fiddling. It's easier to quick-start an exercise with the Versa. It's waterproof, at last. This tracker is shower and swim-friendly, which the Charge 2 wasn't. That's a big deal, and matches the Ionic and Versa watches. There are apps, but just a few. Call them modes or apps or whatever you like, but there's an Exercise mode, a Relax mode, weather, an alarm, a stopwatch and timer. Fitbit might add more apps in the future, but there isn't an app store like the Versa or Ionic. There are watch faces, but just a few. Again, there are a handful of watch face styles that mix stats and time, which can be selected from the Fitbit phone app. But there aren't any others, unlike the hundreds of fun Versa options. It doesn't have Fitbit's extra coaching app. I don't use Fitbit Coach and I'm not wild about subscription services, but it's not even accessible on the Charge 3. The Versa has a Coach app and a few free workouts included. Fitbit's phone app remains a strong suit. There's optional Fitbit Pay, but no music storage or remote playback. A $20 step-up edition includes NFC-based Fitbit Pay and an extra strap, which isn't a bad deal. Fitbit Pay doesn't work with as many banks as Apple Pay, Google Pay and others, though... it still doesn't work with my credit card, which is from a pretty mainstream US bank. Also, for music-workout people, keep in mind that unlike the Versa and Ionic, which can store MP3s sideloaded from a PC, and also do basic remote-control music playback from music on a phone, the Charge 3 doesn't have any music support at all. Heart rate's been a little weird on my review unit so far. As always, getting always-on heart rate stats is helpful... but so far the readings run high. I love Fitbit's instant heart rate readings. But my resting heart rate is reading a lot higher so far than my actual physical pulse, or what the Apple Watch on my other wrist tells me. I'll report more on this as I keep wearing the Charge 3. It's hard to tell what's going on. Nowhere near as feature-rich as the Apple Watch, but it does have better battery life and sleep tracking. The Apple Watch Series 3 has music, optional cellular, a speakerphone, headphone support, a microphone for Siri and the Series 4 even has an EKG and fall detection. But the Apple Watch costs more ($270 and up), only has a day and a half of battery, and doesn't have baked-in sleep tracking. The Fitbit Charge 3 promises seven days of battery life (so far three and counting), and can track sleep, and it costs far less. A full review will come in the following week or so once we've tested more. Fitbit Versa review: $199 and mostly great. Best smartwatches for 2018: Hand-picked by CNET's editors."
CNET,"iPhone XS specs vs. XS Max, XR, X: What's new and different",10/07/18,https://www.cnet.com/news/iphone-xs-specs-max-xr-compared-x-what-is-new-and-different/," The iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR phones are updates to last year's iPhone X, 8 and 8 Plus. The iPhone XS retains the familiar design of the iPhone X, including a 5.8-inch OLED display and stainless-steel sides. Apple also offers a larger version of the XS with a 6.5-inch OLED display called the iPhone XS Max. With a footprint about the same size as the iPhone 8 Plus (the 8 Plus however has a 5.5-inch LCD display), the iPhone XS Max has the largest display found on any iPhone. The iPhone XS and XS Max come in silver, space gray and gold. Apple opted for more of a straw-colored gold this time than for previous more goldy gold iPhone models. Then, there's the iPhone XR, which has a 6.1-inch LCD display and an aluminum and glass body instead of the stainless steel and glass of the XS and XS Max. The iPhone XR comes in white, black, coral, yellow, blue and red (Product Red) and costs $749, £749 or AU$1,229. That's $50, £50 or AU$150 more than the iPhone 8 cost when it launched last year. The XR's colors are a callback to the iPhone 5C. The iPhone XS, like last year's iPhone X, starts at $999, £999 or AU$1,629 for a 64GB model, while the iPhone XS Max costs $1,099, £1,099 or AU$1,799 for 64GB. All three new phones have a new A12 Bionic processor that Apple claims is 15 percent faster than last year's A11 chip in the iPhone X. The iPhone XR has a single rear camera, and the XS and XS Max both have dual rear cameras like the iPhone X. The iPhone XS and XS Max are both available now. The iPhone XR will be available to preorder on Friday Oct. 19. To put it all in perspective, check out the chart below, which compares the iPhone XS, XS Max, XR and last year's X.

CNET,Here’s what all the new emoji really mean,10/06/18,https://www.cnet.com/how-to/what-the-new-iphone-emoji-really-mean/," Apple has introduced more than 70 new emoji that are on deck for release, opening up a new world of communicative possibilities for your texts and social media posts. It won't be long before these emoji are used in multiple ways beyond the obvious to make a point or a punchline. And not to go all predictive text on you, but it's a good time to start learning about what's on the way and how you can use them. You'll be able to start using the new emoji when iOS 12.1 is released to the general public; they'll also become available in future software updates on MacOS and WatchOS. If you prefer instant gratification, you can get them right now if you join Apple's public beta program. There are new animals (like a lobster, parrot and raccoon), sporting goods (skateboard, tennis ball and lacrosse stick), international holiday symbols (such as a Chinese red gift envelope and moon cake), new facial expressions (happy in love) and tweaks to existing faces, like the addition of grey hair and bald heads. Like any emoji, you can communicate with them by using them to represent emotions, points or punchlines. You can use them for literal messages or sometimes to even convey the literal opposite of what you want to say. There's room to find your own form of personal expression within these characters, but here are some suggestions to get started: This set of newcomers can help you decide what to snack on but they can also introduce new terms of endearment into your conversations. For example, the cupcake emoji, which so far is much less controversial than the bagel emoji, could be a sweet new way to address a loved one, though the bagel could be used as a symbol for cuddling along with the cupcaking. Yes, this one can mean lettuce, salad or even cannabis if you like to use rap parlance. But there's also hidden pun potential behind this leafy emoji. Lettuce entertain you with the new lettuce emoji every time you want to say, ""Let's!"" Thank you, I'll be here all week, try the llama (one of the cutest of the new animal additions, by the way). Best believe this blue dude is going to mean more than it's not hot outside. Think of it as a new retort in social exchanges when someone is being just a little bit too cold, an emoji to express extreme chill in the vibes sense, or a symbol for being so embarrassed or scared that you're just totally frozen. Time to have some fun with phrases with these new emoji. Here's one: if someone is making it hard for you to score (in life or on the field), they're throwing salt in your game. The not-so-humble eggplant emoji has come to be known as a symbol for male private parts, and while it will probably stay in favor for some time, there might be some stiff new competition. The flamboyant, feathery new peacock emoji seems to have the potential to go long on sexy text innuendo.

VERGE,Ring CEO Jamie Siminoff wants to reduce neighborhood crime,10/09/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/9/17953050/ring-ceo-jamie-siminoff-interview-smart-video-doorbell-security-police," Ring began as a humble crowdfunded project called Doorbot — a Wi-Fi-enabled video doorbell that enabled two-way communication. In 2013, it was rejected on Shark Tank. This year, the company was acquired by Amazon for over $1 billion. Nilay sat down with Ring CEO Jamie Siminoff on this week’s Vergecast to talk about joining the Amazon family of brands, the future of security in smart homes, and how Ring product owners may (or may not) work with law enforcement to make neighborhoods safer. Below is a brief, edited transcript of their discussion about sharing video and other security data with the police: Nilay Patel: Are you doing anything in the app to sort of provide a check on — here’s a group of neighbors. They see someone. They immediately go to the police and say, “Get this person out of my neighborhood,” right? Like, that could be a problematic result in many cases. Jamie Siminoff: Yeah. But what’s nice about video, the police are able to see what you’re talking about. And so before it’s someone calling up and saying, “Hey, this X-Y-Z person did this and that. And I need this,” and all they have to go on is that. Whereas with this, it’s like, “Here’s this video. I have this problem.” And the police can say, “Okay. We’ll look into it.” But maybe they see it, and they say, “This is not a problem.” Or they say, “Okay. Maybe this is something we need to follow up on. Let’s follow up on it.” I think one of the problems the police has, if you look at it from almost a business side, is, they’re in the business of making very big decisions with very limited data. And we’re trying to just give them better data, to have them make better decisions, because I think if you agree that there needs to be police in order to have a safer society, then there needs to be people that help them to make better decisions. Nilay Patel: So are you actively helping them understand how to watch a Ring video? When you think about that public-private partnership, is Ring in the middle of it? Jamie Siminoff: Everything starts with the idea that your Ring, your data, is 100 percent yours. And it will never be shared, never auto-shared, never opted in to share. There is no place, there is no time that your data will be shared without you, at the time, saying, “Here, take this, because I think it’ll help you.” And so the whole idea is to build a system where you have all these neighbors that want to live safer, but they also want their privacy protected. You have police that don’t necessarily want your data, unless it’s pertinent to them at the time. And so building a system that allows that to happen is what we’re doing. So we’re making the ability for, at the time that something happens, for the police to say, “Hey, if we had this, it might help us.” And you say, “Okay, sure. I have this, and I’ll help you with that.” Making it so that everyone is comfortable about what’s happening, because we are a security company. We’re a neighbor security company. We don’t sell to police. We sell to people that live in communities. And as soon as they lose trust with us, that will be the day that we end our business. The Vergecast"
VERGE,Asus’ gaming phone will be available to preorder in the US on October 18th,10/09/18,https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/9/17955156/asus-gaming-phone-preorder-us-date," Asus’ bonkers gaming ROG Phone is coming to the US after its debut at Computex earlier this year. The phone follows Razer’s first foray into gaming phones and features a 90Hz display along with a 2.96GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor. It starts at $899 and will be available to preorder through the Asus Store, Amazon, and Microsoft on October 18th, although Asus hasn’t announced a shipping date yet. The phone’s accessories will follow later this year and are priced as follows: As The Verge’s Vlad Savov noted in his initial impressions, accessories are a major part of this phone’s release. Sure, you could just game on the phone, but you’ll probably want the gamepad setup and the ability to stream directly to your TV. This phone might be wildly impractical, but nonetheless, it’s worth giving a shout-out to the Asus team for all the effort that went into making a true gaming phone, complete with accessories and everything.  It’s a neat concept, but do you want to spend nearly $900 on it? You could buy multiple actual gaming consoles for that price, along with games. "
VERGE,How to buy Intel’s new 9th Gen processors,10/09/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/9/17955268/intel-new-9th-gen-processor-how-to-buy," Intel’s new 9th Gen Core i5, i7, and i9 processors are now available for preorder. While we’re still eagerly awaiting the company’s oft-delayed 10nm Cannon Lake CPU, the latest family of processors are bringing some welcomed improvements. From a security standpoint, they are each protected against Meltdown Variant 3 and L1 Terminal Fault issues. More generally, power users can expect a hearty bump up in performance — especially if you buy into the new i9-9900K, which Intel claims is the “best gaming processor in the world. Period.”

   If you’re looking to upgrade your current PC, preordering now will guarantee delivery on or around launch day, which is currently set at October 19th. Here are a few places where you can buy a new 9th Gen Intel CPU. Installing the new CPU into your current rig should be fairly easy, as long as you have the correct motherboard. Like the previous generation, Intel’s 9th Gen maintains the same LGA 1151 socket and requires a motherboard with an Intel 300 Series chipset. Thankfully, those are easy to find and not too expensive, though if you haven’t upgraded your CPU in some time, you’ll have to really uproot your system to make the new processor play nicely. Of course, if you don’t yet own a powerful PC, plenty of manufacturers were quick to implement Intel’s 9th Gen CPUs into their prebuilt offerings. To name a few examples, Origin already offers its fleet of desktops and laptops with up to the Core i9 preinstalled at checkout. Asus, Maingear, and Dell are also ready with Intel’s latest processor in their upcoming offerings, and more are on the way soon."
VERGE,UK retailer temporarily sold the new Google Chromecast this morning,10/09/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/9/17955110/google-chromecast-leak-uk-best-buy-walmart," In the weeks leading up to today’s Made by Google event, leaks of the latest Chromecast model surfaced pretty much... everywhere. At Best Buy and Walmart, customers were able to pick them off the shelves and walk out before the device was even officially announced. Just hours before today’s event, an online retailer in the UK listed the device as up for purchase, allowing you to add it to your basket and check out. The item is listed at £29.99. The listing has since been updated to say it is “unavailable,” but the link to the product page is still active if you want to spend the rest of your morning refreshing and waiting for the message to switch back to “in stock.” There’s nearly nothing left to leak at this point, so maybe you should just join us on The Verge’s live blog coverage of the Made by Google event to see if the company has any surprises left in store."
VERGE,The robotic farm of the future isn’t what you’d expect,10/09/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/9/17950502/robot-farm-future-iron-ox-agriculture-automation," When we think about automation, we often imagine robots just doing the work of humans. Our mental image is of an android in overalls, clocking in with a lunchbox full of oil and bolts, and grabbing a hammer. But that’s not what happens. The reality is much messier, and the process of automation is one of compromise and incremental progress.  Agritech startup Iron Ox is the perfect example of this. After launching in 2015 with the aim of automating the hard work of growing produce, the company unveiled its first “autonomous” production farm last week. In 8,000 square feet of indoor space (roughly 0.2 acres), its engineers use proprietary robot systems to grow roughly 26,000 heads of lettuce, leafy greens, and herbs each year in hydroponic vats. The company says it should start selling its crop in “the next couple of months,” and it will be targeting restaurants first. But, as co-founder and CEO Brandon Alexander explains to The Verge, despite the “autonomous” moniker, humans still play crucial roles in this farm. They are the ones who plant each seedling and package the finished product. Robots just aren’t ready to do it all. Getting to even this level of automation took years of work to navigate the constraints of modern robotics, says Alexander, who previously worked at Google’s research lab X and at influential robotics incubator Willow Garage. “There’s a huge difference between your equipment working one time for a video and it working every day,” he says. “Most people outside of robotics underestimate just how big that gap is.”  Hydroponics has a lot of advantages over traditional farming. It uses less water, it’s completely sterile, and it’s much more space efficient. (Iron Ox claims it grows 30 times more produce per acre than a regular farm.) But it also requires more labor. In the sort of hydroponics system that Iron Ox uses, each plant has to be transferred one by one through a series of different growing vats based on its rate of growth. It’s this simple task — moving plants — that has been the focus of Iron Ox’s automation efforts.  “The bulk of the cost [in hydroponic farming] is all those touch points,” says Alexander. “Labor is over 50 percent of the cost to grow right now. If you’re indoors, there are no tractors, no nothing, so it’s a very manual product.”  To overcome this, Iron Ox developed two robotic systems. The first is a porter: a 1,000-pound wheeled bot named Angus that moves pallets of seedlings around the warehouse in their hydroponic growing vats. The second is a robotic arm (currently unnamed) that picks up individual plants and moves them from vat to vat. All of this is overseen by a computer program (nicknamed “the Brain”) that monitors the growing conditions in each pallet and adjusts their balance of gases and nutrients for optimal growing conditions. Alexander says it was a huge amount of work just to get to this level, reeling off a list of problems the team faced. There was the lighting, he says, as Iron Ox had initially planned to use all LEDs for growing. “But that results in electricity bills that are simply too expensive. So, going forward, we’re betting on more traditional greenhouses augmented by LEDs.” There was also a myriad of robotic challenges in developing things like leaf detection for the robot arm so it doesn’t drag plants through one another when moving them, and designing Angus to accelerate and decelerate at gentle rates so it didn’t slop growing medium out of the vats. “The best motivator for engineers to solve that problem was having to clean up the water afterward,” says Alexander. Overcoming these technical problems was tricky, but it’s nothing compared to the challenge that the company now faces: cost. If Iron Ox truly wants to change farming, it needs to compete on price with modern outdoor farms that have been optimized over the past century to produce incredible amounts of produce as cheaply as possible.  Jonathan Gill, a robotics researcher at Harper Adams University and co-founder of the Hands Free Hectare, an automated farming project in the UK, says this will be difficult. Only “minimal amounts” of the global agricultural industry have been automated to date, says Gill, simply because it’s not “economically viable” to do so. The robots aren’t good enough, human labor is cheaper, and those equations aren’t going to change just for Iron Ox, he says. “It’s just not necessarily the most efficient method of growing food for the world.”  But, says Gill, Iron Ox has other advantages. “They’re always going to be able to market it as a premium product,” says Gill. “[Their produce] is completely organic, has little to no human input, and they can claim it’s fresher and has fewer food miles than competitors.”  They can also grow closer to customers and adapt their crops to last-minute changes in demand. “Here in the UK, we had a very hot summer, and as soon as it passed 30 degrees [Celsius], the lettuce stopped growing,” says Gill. Supermarkets went through a salad shortage, but in that sort of situation, Iron Ox will be able to “guarantee a market push-through for large customers.”  Alexander mentions the same benefits and says Iron Ox farms will be located near urban centers and will easily adapt to the whims of the market. But he also claims they’ll compete with big farms on price “from day one.” This first farm will sell greens to small customers first, but Alexander claims they’ll be selling to big chains by 2019.  “Our ultimate goal is not to sell produce to bougie grocery stores,” says Alexander. “[Our rivals] are huge outdoor fields, and if we can’t compete with them, we’re always going to be a niche player.” "

VERGE,Marshall announces Minor II Bluetooth in-ear wireless headphones,10/09/18,https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/9/17954922/marshall-minor-ii-bluetooth-in-ear-wireless-headphones-acton-stanmore-woburn-update," Most of Marshall’s consumer lineup focuses on over-ear or on-ear headphones, but today, the Zound Industries-licensed branch of the guitar amp company is announcing an upgrade to its Minor in-ear wireless headphones called the Minor II Bluetooth. The Minor II Bluetooth are the first pair of wireless in-ear headphones that Marshall has made. They have the same basic design as the original Minor wired headphones that were released in 2011, but they add a few big updates to make the jump the Bluetooth. There’s a new ear loop design to help the headphones stay in your ears and a microphone / battery module that hangs on the right side of the connecting cable that also features one of Marshall’s excellent joystick-style control knobs for raising / lowering the volume and skipping tracks. There’s also a new auto-pause feature: stick the two magnetic earbuds together, and your song will automatically pause. Marshall says Minor II Bluetooth earbuds should get up to 12 hours off a charge, and its quick-charge tech will get you two hours of music off a 20-minute charge (or two hours of charging to get back to full). On the spec side of things, the Minor II Bluetooth support Bluetooth aptX audio and the latest Bluetooth 5.0 standard.  And since they’re Marshall headphones, there are some lovely-looking brass accents.  The Minor II Bluetooth earbuds are available today from Marshall’s website for $129. Additionally, Marshall is upgrading the regular Bluetooth versions of its home speakers with a new visual design and better sound. (The Wi-Fi versions already got a similar update at IFA that also added Alexa support.)  The updated Acton II, Stanmore II, and Woburn II Bluetooth speakers now have the same gray and gold grilles on the front (which are meant to evoke a stage microphone) and an improved digital signal processor that Marshall says should allow for better sound even at higher volumes. The new versions of the speakers also feature Bluetooth 5.0 and support the option to connect two phones at once.  All three speakers still offer all the things that made the first generation of Marshall Bluetooth speakers great: high-quality sound, good design, and fantastic tactile volume-control knobs for adjusting volume, bass, and treble straight from the speaker. There’s no Wi-Fi or multiroom audio, though. Those features are limited to the Stanmore II Voice and Acton II Voice models that Marshall announced earlier this year. The largest Woburn model hasn’t gotten an Alexa-equipped Voice variant yet. The Acton II will cost $249, the Stanmore II will cost $349 (or $50 less than their respective Wi-Fi variants), and the Woburn II will cost $499.  "
VERGE,June’s smart oven can now cook pre-packaged Whole Foods meals,10/09/18,https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/9/17954876/june-whole-foods-smart-oven-integration," June’s smart oven is supposed to be capable of scanning, analyzing, and properly cooking whatever foods you throw in it, but today, it’s getting some more specific cooking options courtesy of Whole Foods. The oven will now include a Whole Foods button, which will let owners select specific Whole Foods products to cook. These will be prepackaged foods specific to the store, which may benefit from additional precision. On one hand, maybe it starts to break the core concept of the June oven if you have to choose the specific meal you want to cook — right now, you just choose a dish, like “lamb chop” or “fries” — and the oven is supposed to more or less take it from there based on preprogrammed instructions. Adding in Whole Foods meals will likely mean better results, though it also means a more specific menu that owners will have to dig through. The integration makes a lot of sense, though, and perhaps it was inevitable. Amazon, which owns Whole Foods, invested in June earlier this year, and this integration means June starts to more directly match what some competitor’s smart ovens do by supporting specific meals. Tovala, for instance, sells meal kits with instructions that are coded into the oven so it can cook them as intended. June says “more than 30” Whole Foods products will be supported at launch. June may have been one of the first into the smart oven space, but it’s in a growing market with technology that’s likely to keep catching on. Traditional kitchen appliances are starting to add in similar scanning features, so we’re likely to see more and more of this as a way to make cooking prepackaged foods an even easier task."
VERGE,This online community expands visibility for female drone pilots,10/09/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/9/17942852/women-who-drone-getty-images-uav-pilots-dji-database," Less than 5 percent of certified drone pilots in the US are women, which is a dreary statistic that highlights the lack of women in STEM industries. The number for women who fly recreationally is likely much higher, but being FAA-certified can open up career opportunities to enter the UAV industry, a fact many likely aren’t aware of. To close the knowledge gap, Elena Buenrostro started Women Who Drone, an online community where female drone pilots, photographers, and videographers can come together and learn from each other.  Buenrostro, who comes from a video production background, was inspired to start flying drones after a trip to the Great Wall of China. When other women in similar creative fields started reaching out to her for drone advice, she decided to start Women Who Drone with her co-founder Laura Chukanov. The #womenwhodrone hashtag on Instagram didn’t exist before the group emerged one year ago; today, there are over 9,000 photos from female drone pilots around the world.

Members share educational resources on safe drone practices along with hosting workshops and online lessons. In addition to featuring photography from over 400 women on the blog so far, the website also offers a database of its women photographers whose work is available for licensing. Last month, the organization partnered with Getty Images to license the Women Who Drone collection, which features drone photography and video footage taken by its brand ambassadors.  The group currently has 44 ambassadors internationally. All of its brand ambassadors based in the US are FAA certified. (It’s required by the government if you want to fly drones for profit and monetize your aerial content.) Having brand ambassadors around the world also allows members to share travel tips, local drone regulations, and areas where it’s safe to fly drones. As the brand ambassador program grows rapidly, Buenrostro is planning to make it easier to search and discover photographers by location.  Last week, the group celebrated its first anniversary at DJI’s New York headquarters, where it was joined by its members, brand ambassadors, and entrepreneurs who have built their businesses around drones. Many of the attendees came across the group online while teaching themselves how to pilot drones through YouTube videos. I spoke to two brand ambassadors who were in attendance, Fallon Chan and Emily Hines. A photographer for 10 years, Fallon Chan picked up her first drone a year ago and stumbled across the group after a quick Google search for “women drone ambassadors.” “I wanted to get my name out there as a photographer and videographer,” Chan said. “I was looking for a way to get more exposure.”  In Brooklyn for a wedding today. A little early so I flew for a few minutes :) . . . . . #djimavic #dji #drone #dronestagram #dronephotography #djimavicpro #drones #dronefly #mavicpro #djiglobal #dronelife #aerialphotography #aerial #mavic #fromwhereidrone #droneporn #djipilot #djilife #brooklynbridge #brooklyn #manhattanbridge #femaledroner #womenwhodrone A post shared by  Fallon Chan (@chandemic) on Mar 4, 2018 at 7:45am PST Alternatively, Emily Hines’ background doesn’t come from photography; she’s a skydiver who’s logged in more than 1,200 jumps. After having kids, she traded in skydiving for a pilot’s license, then moved on to building her own company that specializes in real estate photography. Her company, Buzz My Property, uses drone footage to showcase huge multimillion-dollar properties and the surrounding areas to give buyers a better sense of the environment. “I got into drones through my love for flying and aviation. Drones are cheaper and faster,” Hines said. Although she’s logging less flight time these days, drones have allowed her to “find a way to stay in the sky and close to aviation.”  The barrier to entry for drones used to be that they were too expensive, but with the release of consumer-friendly drones like the DJI Spark, drones have become more accessible than ever for hobbyists. Combined with the education and resources that Women Who Drone provides, women can learn to monetize their hobbies and use them as jumping-off points to go deeper into the drone industry. Currently, the group is crowdfunding to raise resources for more workshops, online courses, and scholarships. “We started off highlighting women who were using drones for visual content. But now, it’s like, look at all these women who are using it for [fields like] 3D mapping and inspection work,” Buenrostro said. “It’s not just for creative content; [it’s] for things like surveillance and humanitarian work,” Chukanov added.

VERGE,Instagram is using AI to detect bullying in photos and captions,10/09/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/9/17954658/instagram-ai-machine-learning-detect-filter-bullying-comments-captions-photos," Last year, Instagram introduced an enhanced comment filter that uses machine learning to spot offensive words and phrases in challenging contexts. Now, the company is expanding similar coverage to photos and captions. Today, it announced that it will use AI to “proactively detect bullying” before sending content to human moderators for review.  The new feature will roll out to users in the coming weeks, launching in time for October’s National Bullying Prevention Month in the US and just before Anti-Bullying Week in the UK. The same technology is also being added to live videos to filter comments there as well.  This is the first product announcement under new Instagram chief Adam Mosseri who took over following the hasty departure of co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger last month. The split was reportedly due to simmering tensions between the pair and parent company Facebook, which has frequently meddled with Instagram’s product.  With public trust in Facebook continuing to fall, Instagram remains the bright spot in the company’s product lineup. It’s popular, profitable, and it has yet to be tainted by the scandals that have undermined Facebook. In this context, using AI to help weed out offensive content and keep Instagram a home for good vibes is extremely important.  A story published in Wired last year explained some of the details of Instagram’s machine learning comment filters, but it’s well-established that this sort of technology is no silver bullet for content moderation. AI is cheap to deploy at scale, yes, but it still has trouble dealing with human context and nuance. That’s why it’s good that these new bullying filters also send content to human moderators to perform the final check. Automation without oversight is a recipe for disaster.  Interestingly, Instagram says it’s not just analyzing photos captions to identify bullying, but also the photo itself. Speaking to The Verge, a spokesperson gave the example of the AI looking for split-screen images as an example of potential bullying, as one person might be negatively compared to another. What other factors the AI will look for though isn’t clear. That might be a good idea considering that when Facebook announced it would scan memes using AI, people immediately started thinking of ways to get around such filters.  Along with the new filters, Instagram is also launching a “kindness camera effect,” which sounds like it’s a way to spread a positive message as a method to boost user engagement. While using the rear camera, the effects fill the screen with an overlay of “kind comments in many languages.” Switch to your front-facing camera, and you get a shimmer of hearts and a polite encouragement to “tag a friend you want to support.”  Update Tuesday October 9th, 9:30AM ET: Story has been updated with additional detail on scanning photos.

VERGE,Devialet shrinks its Phantom speaker but keeps signature sci-fi design intact,10/09/18,https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/9/17954832/devialet-phantom-reactor-speaker-release-date-features-price," Devialet has announced a new compact version of its eye-catching Phantom speaker. Called the Phantom Reactor, the new model is just a quarter of the size of the previous Phantom, but it attempts to preserve much of the pricey original’s appeal.  What people like about the Phantom speakers — aside from the fact that they look like a Daft Punk-designed Xenomorph egg — is their ability to get ridiculously loud without distortion while generating an impressively wide soundstage from a comparatively small enclosure. A full range of streaming services are supported (including Spotify Connect, AirPlay, and Bluetooth), and multiple Phantoms can be paired together to create a stereo or multiroom system. There are two versions of the new Reactor available, offering you the choice of a total amplification power of 600W or 900W, but neither is particularly cheap. Prices start at $999 for the 600W model, while the more powerful version will set you back $1,299. Both will be released on October 24th."
VERGE,"Google’s Pixel 3 won’t surprise you, but it might delight you",10/09/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/9/17943672/google-pixel-3-xl-notch-camera-design-features-pros-cons," All the leaks and prejudgment in the buildup to the launch of Google’s Pixel 3 this week reminds me of how the original Pixel made its way into the world. Two years ago, as now, Google’s flagship phone set a new high-water mark for pre-announcement leaks. The original Pixel was also a dowdy slab of big-bezel electronics, and the new Pixel XL doesn’t do much better, featuring arguably the ugliest and most intrusive notch — a hotly-contested prize — we’ve yet seen. The new Pixels look every bit as unexciting and quotidian as their predecessors. They have no sliding camera modules or iridescent paint jobs, and their new color this year seems almost reluctant to admit to being pink. I’ll understand if you find yourself underwhelmed. Google's Pixel phone has already earned the prize for being the most comprehensively leaked (and prejudged) gadget in history. But haven’t we already made the mistake of judging things on their appearance too quickly? Many of us freaked out about the iPhone X’s notch, however Apple’s iPhone sales have hardly been upset by it. I derided the unattractiveness of Apple’s AirPods when they were first announced, only to later eat my words. And when the original Pixel arrived at my home for review, I’ll never forget this, I found its design so bland that I left it in its box and instead spent time with Sony’s forgettable, but prettier, Xperia X-whatever of the time.  When I did get around to checking out the Pixel, it’s safe to say that it transformed my mobile life. There is a distinct break between the pre-Pixel era of my phone photos — characterized by liberal use of filters, edits, and transformations from apps like Prisma — and the ones I started taking with the Pixel. It was the first phone that could legitimately compete with DSLR camera quality while still being a respectable modern smartphone. Unlike Nokia’s 808 PureView or Lumia 1020, the two previous awesome cameraphones, the Pixel ran the latest and best edition of Android, and so it was a device I actively wanted to use for everything else beside images.

   The second-generation Pixel couldn’t possibly improve on the camera of the first, I thought, and it really didn’t need to. When Google reduced the pixel size (ironic or what?) on the imaging sensor of the Pixel 2, I worried that things might actually get worse, but the Pixel 2 turned out to be significantly better than the original. This year, I used the Pixel 2 XL exclusively to capture all my photos from the Paris and Geneva Motor Shows. And all my photos from Photokina in Cologne. Oh, and every single shot from Computex in Taipei. I also went to Tokyo for the first time, and my Pixel was the only device I needed: both to find my way around the world’s most intricate transport system and to capture the local sights. Every year before the Pixel, I would take a few hundreds photos on my phone. Since I switched to using Google’s phone, I’ve shot more than 20,000. The camera’s quality has enticed me to keep trying new, more challenging scenarios — but an often overlooked feature of the Pixel’s stickiness for its users is the free cloud storage that Google provides for full-resolution photos and videos shot with the device. I’ve long ago blown past the default 15GB of free storage I get with my Google account, but because all I’m shooting is Pixel content, it doesn’t count against my quota. Stop and think about the possibility of Google actually improving on the Pixel 2 camera. The same camera that has replaced my professional camera. The same one that takes the sheen off Apple’s best iPhone camera ever. I refuse to be so jaded as to not acknowledge how freaking exciting that makes the Pixel 3. Improving the Pixel’s camera would be raising the bar for the most widely-used sort of photography today: shooting with our phones. I may sound like a broken record singing the Pixel’s praises, but the people who say the Pixel doesn’t matter constantly reiterate that few people even know about it. And they’re right. Google has failed to distribute its devices widely enough, limiting availability to only a handful of mostly Anglophone countries, sometimes further limiting choice by opting for carrier exclusives. The Pixel is the best combination of smartphone and camera the world has ever witnessed, but Google makes it incredibly difficult for most of the world to witness it in person. So I’m here banging the drum for everyone to pay attention. We’ve seen enough of the Pixel 3 to know it won’t be beautiful. But Google’s hardware business is about selling us pretty pixels, not pretty Pixels."

But if you haven’t kept up with the rumor mill, Google is almost certainly announcing a new Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL, with the smaller Pixel 3 moving to a more modern 18:9 aspect ratio, and the XL to get a very tall camera notch. Both phones are also expected to get some other upgrades, including a new Snapdragon 845 processor, wireless charging, better cameras, and maybe even included USB-C Pixel Buds.

VERGE,OnePlus 6T gets November 6th release date,10/09/18,https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/9/17954748/oneplus-6t-on-sale-november-6," The OnePlus 6T will be available from November 6th, OnePlus has confirmed. The phone, which is due to be announced at a New York event on October 30th, still doesn’t have an official price or specs, but is expected to include an in-display fingerprint sensor, and will be the first OnePlus device to ship without a 3.5mm headphone jack.  Over the last three years, OnePlus has followed a similar schedule for the release of its handsets. The first half of the year sees the release of a numbered phone (the OnePlus 3 in 2016, OnePlus 5 in 2017 and OnePlus 6 in 2018), while the company tends to follow these with a second device in the latter half of the year that has a “T” suffix. Changes made with these devices has varied. The 3 and 3T differed in specs while being physically more or less identical, while the 5T had identical specs to the 5 but featured a larger screen and face unlock functionality.  Currently, the 6T looks similar to a 5T-style upgrade, but with its specs yet to be officially announced we could still see a few surprises. The launch event is scheduled to take place at 11AM local time in New York City. "
VERGE,Facebook’s launch of Portal has been stymied by trust issues,10/09/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/9/17953814/facebook-portal-privacy-trust-camera-speaker," Facebook is a powerful phone book, but it long ago opted against building a phone. There were good reasons not to build a phone. One, the risk of failure was high — at the time, Windows Phone was sputtering, and the iOS/Android duopoly looked increasingly impenetrable. Two, it would have put Facebook in direct competition with Google and Apple, risking an ugly conflict with the two biggest platforms on which the company depends. But in search of new growth, Facebook ultimately came back around to the idea of building its own hardware — and, in a way, back to the phone. First came the Oculus acquisition, which turned Facebook into a manufacturer of virtual-reality gear. And today comes Portal, a video phone that runs on Facebook Messenger. Here’s my colleague Jake Kastrenakes with the gist: The Portal is designed to simplify video chatting by having a wide-angle camera capable of identifying your body, then tracking you as you move around the room. It makes for more comfortable chatting than holding a phone up to your face for extended periods of time. Facebook says the Portal is designed to create the sense that you’re sharing one big room with the people you’re talking to, and considers the chats you have on the device an augmented reality experience. With the Portal, you don’t have to hold, aim, or direct anything. Once a chat starts up, the device’s camera will automatically find people in the room and keep them in frame. If multiple people are in a room, the camera will use a wide angle to fit them all. If there’s only one person, the camera will zoom in to focus on their face. Facebook says this feature makes video chatting more natural, since you can just talk without worrying about camera angles. I played around with Portal last week during a meeting with the Facebook team behind the device. As a thought experiment, I tried to imagine how I would feel about the device if I didn’t know who made it. The design struck me as goofy but functional: similar to the Echo Show, in its smaller version, and in the larger version, like a Square point-of-sale device. As a video phone, it worked as advertised. The marquee feature is a kind of dynamic cropping that constantly adjusts the angle depending on how many people are in the frame and where they’re moving. The company says this is a step toward VR-style “presence,” which feels like an oversell. But it seems useful. The other striking thing about Portal is how little it does. Aside from making video calls, it can play music through Spotify or Pandora, play videos through Facebook Watch, or cycle through photos in an album of your choosing. Amazon’s Alexa is integrated into the hardware, and so it can do Alexa things. And that’s about it. Single-purpose tools can be powerful in their simplicity — hammers, say, portable Bluetooth speakers. But if you’ve ever walked through Sur La Table and marveled at the strawberry corers and avocado slicers, you know they can also be a little ridiculous. If you can afford a $200 or $350 Portal, you probably already have a phone, a tablet, and laptop — and maybe an Echo or two — all of which can do everything the Portal does, and more.  The reason to buy one is because you make video calls so much that you’re willing to invest in dedicated hardware, and give it a permanent spot in your home. I have no idea how many people feel that way, but as a device that serves that particular thesis, the Portal seems worthy enough. As version 1.0 hardware from a company with little manufacturing experience, it’s a solid effort. The question is whether it’s a hammer or an avocado slicer — and at launch, it looks more like the latter to me. Anyway, that’s how I’d review the Portal if I didn’t know who made it. But we do know who made it, and rarely in the history of gadget reviewing have I seen so many independent journalists come to identical conclusions about a device. The issue, of course, is trust. And the press corps doesn’t trust Facebook to put an always-on microphone and camera in their home. Even if it comes with a plastic camera cover and an off-switch for the microphone. Here’s a sampling of the day’s zingers: There are a lot more like that. Perhaps demand will be stronger than reporters are predicting. Still, the fact remains that this is a device whose launch was delayed in the midst of one privacy scandal (Cambridge Analytica) only to arrive in the midst of another one. I’m not sure what a good time to launch Portal would have been this year. But there haven’t been many worse ones. Google Exposed User Data, Feared Repercussions of Disclosing to Public Doug MacMillan and Robert McMillan have a blockbuster today about how Google identified a significant data vulnerability in Google+, didn’t tell anyone about it, and are now shutting down the consumer-facing parts of its ersatz social network for good. It certainly all looks very bad, although there’s no evidence that anyone exploited the vulnerability. (The counterpoint, and it’s an important one, is that Google regularly purges the relevant logs, and so it can’t say for sure.) A software glitch in the social site gave outside developers potential access to private Google+ profile data between 2015 and March 2018, when internal investigators discovered and fixed the issue, according to the documents and people briefed on the incident. A memo reviewed by the Journal prepared by Google’s legal and policy staff and shared with senior executives warned that disclosing the incident would likely trigger “immediate regulatory interest” and invite comparisons to Facebook’s leak of user information to data firm Cambridge Analytica. Chief Executive Sundar Pichai was briefed on the plan not to notify users after an internal committee had reached that decision, the people said. Tech Workers Now Want to Know: What Are We Building This For? In August, I wrote about the growing threat of a wide-scale employee revolt inside Google over Project Dragonfly. Kate Conger and Cade Metz have some fresh interviews with employees who quit over the issue. Among the good points they raise is that there’s seemingly no way of working at Google without working on Dragonfly, at least indirectly: “You can think you’re building technology for one purpose, and then you find out it’s really twisted,” said Laura Nolan, 38, a senior software engineer who resigned from Google in June over the company’s involvement in Project Maven, an effort to build artificial intelligence for the Department of Defense that could be used to target drone strikes. DOJ demands Facebook info from ‘anti-administration activists Here’s an unsettling report from Jessica Schneider: Trump administration lawyers are demanding the private account information of potentially thousands of Facebook users in three separate search warrants served on the social media giant, according to court documents obtained by CNN.

After Troubles in Myanmar, Facebook Charges Ahead in Africa Nitasha Tiku has a timely look at how Facebook’s ambitions in Africa have not been dimmed by its experiences in other developing nations: Facebook would not disclose how many Express Wi-Fi hot spots there are or how the program has grown, but it is clearly part of Facebook’s larger push into Africa. Three of the five countries where Express Wi-Fi has launched are in Africa. In March, Facebook launched an Express Wi-Fi app in the Google Play store in Kenya and Indonesia. Facebook’s ISP partner in Kenya, Surf, says it has 1,100 Express Wi-Fi hot spots in the country, up from 100 in February 2017. In September, Facebook announced a partnership with The Internet Society, an American nonprofit, to improve internet connections throughout Africa. Digital rights advocates in Africa say Facebook has evolved its approach after the problems in Myanmar. Facebook is working more closely with civil society groups, sending more delegations, recruiting native language speakers, planning for contentious elections, and hosting digital literacy efforts. Facebook Exec Admits One Small Misstep in Kavanaugh Hearing Trip Contrary to an item I had here last week, Sarah Frier says Joel Kaplan did not apologize for supporting Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing. I tend to believe Sarah here, since Kaplan hosted a party for the judge this weekend after he was confirmed. Brett Kavanaugh and the Information Terrorists Trying to Reshape America Molly McKew calls Alex Jones, Mike Cernovich and other popular social-media stars “an operational unit of information terrorists helping to transform the way Americans consume news in the age of Trump.” In a long piece, she traces the development of these tactics from Gamergate through the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings: Once information architecture is in place, it’s like pipes. You just inject new material into the system, and it gets where it needs to go faster and faster as people get used to receiving narratives and themes in a certain context from certain sources. On the far-right, in particular, there has been a concerted effort to recruit people to participate in this process. They act as human amplifiers, both organic and automated, within these narrative structures. (I outlined an example of this here; it irritated this network so much, there are two “Q cards” that reference that piece). This process of unleashing conspiracies is not just an online activity. This is about behavioral change. And often, in the case of the far-right, about different forms of radicalization. Facebook Will Set Up An Election Task Force In India Ahead Of Major Elections Facebook is setting up some sort of task force to monitor attempts at election interference in India, Pranav Dixit reports. Details are still vague: “The team will have security specialists and content specialists, among others, who will try to understand all the possible forms of election-related abuse in India,“ Richard Allan, Facebook’s vice president of global policy solutions, told reporters at a convention organized by an Indian media house on Saturday, according to a report by the Indian newswire service IANS. Allan said that the task force will also work with India’s political parties and will try to understand all the ways bad actors can manipulate the platform in India. Members of the task force will be based in India, but it is unclear at this point how many there will be. WhatsApp, Reliance Jio launches campaign for responsible app use on JioPhones An Indian carrier named Reliance Jio us trying to educate the public about responsible WhatsApp usage.

We are excited to… help organise a campaign that educates people on how to communicate in a simple and safe way,” a WhatsApp spokesperson said in a statement. Brazil Election Results: Far-Right Candidate Heads to Runoff After Missing Outright Win The rise of far-right politician Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil may sound familiar to Americans: Mr. Bolsonaro’s first-round victory was all the more remarkable because he lacked the backing of a major party and campaigned on a shoestring budget, relying mainly on social media to build a base. As of mid-September, the Bolsonaro campaign reported having spent about $235,000, a small fraction of the $6.3 million the Haddad campaign disclosed having spent. Why we’re losing the battle against fake news Mark Scott looks at the landscape of fake-news regulations and finds that, as usual, the technologists are ahead of the politicians: The fake news merchants are a step ahead, thanks to techniques that allow them to mask their location, masquerade as local activists and purchase political ads in countries’ local currencies to dodge rules against foreign influence. The new tricks, which also include a shift to photo-based disinformation and use of internet messaging services like WhatsApp, are designed to defeat our outdated definition of what constitutes fake news — foreign-bought, easily identifiable and blatantly false. Viral video of Russian woman bleaching manspreaders was anti-feminist propaganda Last month, a video of a woman allegedly dumping water mixed with bleach into the laps of manspreaders went viral, Megan Farokhmanesh. But it was a hoax: According to a St. Petersburg-based publication, one of the men featured in the video said the whole thing was staged and the men were paid actors. “They poured water on us,” he wrote on a Facebook post sharing the video in his now-deleted profile. “That feeling when you come to the shooting with two spare pants and leave with a salary.” The publication also suggests that the video was shot by My Duck’s Vision, a studio with Kremlin ties that specializes in viral videos. My Duck’s Vision has denied involvement. Facebook poaches leaders of Refdash interview prep to work on Jobs Facebook as a LinkedIn competitor is interesting to me, because the less people use Facebook to post about their personal lives, the more it feels like LinkedIn anyway. Josh Constine reports it just picked up two people from a recruiting startup to work on its Jobs product. Facebook announces Portal, an Echo Show rival focused on video chat It’s worth reading our entire piece about Portal, which gets into the nitty-gritty of what it can do and adds good context around the launch. (I edited it. See if you can find my fingerprints!) Facebook Messenger internally tests voice commands for chat, calls “Facebook Messenger could soon let you use your voice to dictate and send messages, initiate voice calls and create reminders,” Josh Constine reports, based on a tweet from Jane Manchun Wong. Camera Effects Platform is now Spark AR Facebook has a new name for its camera effects platform. Personally, I found Camera Effects Platform more descriptive! Google Privacy Glitch: No, We Did Not Consent to This Shira Ovide has a great piece on how the recent Facebook and Google breaches have an important similarity: “consumers still can’t make informed choices about safeguarding their digital information.” More than a decade into the era of prevalent social networks and smartphones, people still have no way to make informed choices about how to safely conduct their lives online.  People may not know all the gory details, but when they choose to use Facebook, Google+, Twitter, WeChat, iPhones and other technology products or services, they generally understand that the companies might collect dossiers on what they read, who they chat with and where they go. But people absolutely do not agree to whatever arrangements those companies make with outside parties to pass along personal information or data. Period. Did Facebook Learn Anything From the Cambridge Analytica Debacle? I bet you can guess what the New York Times editorial board thinks just by reading the headline out loud in your most exasperated voice: While the Cambridge Analytica scandal engulfed Facebook in a firestorm of controversy, this time the company effectively got a free pass from a nation fixated on Brett Kavanaugh and his turbulent Supreme Court confirmation. Still, with consequential midterms less than a month away, this latest string of Facebook privacy failures is a discouraging reminder of how much potential there is for things to go terribly wrong — again — during those elections. It’s not just about user privacy, it’s a sign of how well Facebook is poised to handle sophisticated foreign disinformation campaigns, and where its priorities lie. For the first time with this issue, I put together The Interface during lunchtime on a reporting trip to LA. I want to thank El Torito for the guest Wi-Fi and the grilled mahi mahi tacos. Both were great. Send me tips, comments, questions, and the number of Portals you will be buying for friends and family this holiday season. casey@theverge.com."
VERGE,Verizon suggests Pixel 3 pricing will start at $799.99,10/09/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/9/17954676/verizon-google-pixel-3-price-800-usd," Google just can’t catch a break with the Pixel 3. A Verizon promotional page suggests that the handset will start at a price of $799.99 for its 64GB model. If true, this would would make it $150 more expensive than the Pixel 2 was at launch.  The deal advertises that consumers can get a second 64GB Pixel 3 for free with the purchase of one of the phones, with the $800 upfront cost of the free device being refunded over the course of a 24 month contract. The deal doesn’t always display on the Verizon Wireless site (we had to refresh a few times and use incognito mode).  A second promotional page uncovered from the My Verizon app (via Reddit) suggests that you’ll also get one of Google’s new wireless charging Pixel Stands for free when pre-ordering through the carrier’s app.  There is some speculation, however, over whether the $800 price tag applies to the standard or XL version of the handset. The phone pictured in the advert appears to be a Pixel 3 XL based on its display notch (which would mean a $50 reduction in price), but the text describing the Buy One Get One deal clearly relates to the Pixel 3. And who knows, maybe it’s all just a placeholder before the deal goes live later today. Nevertheless, based on existing price leaks as well as the general trend towards more expensive handsets, we’re inclined to believe it’s describing the non-XL variant. Verizon’s BoGo deals typically apply to entry-level models. The Pixel 3 is once again expected to be a Verizon exclusive in the US as it was for both the original Pixel and Pixel 2. Stay tuned for the phone’s official launch starting at 11AM ET later today.  "

The iPad Pros will indeed have a USB-C port, according to Rambo, and it’ll be capable of outputting 4K HDR video to compatible external displays. There’s no word on any other specific functionality, nor whether the Lightning port will be preserved.  Rambo also confirms that Face ID will replace Touch ID, but unlike on iPhones it’ll be possible to use the system in both portrait and landscape mode, and there won’t be a notch for the face-scanning depth camera. Elsewhere, the report says that a new version of the Apple Pencil with AirPods-style proximity-based pairing is on the way, while there’ll be a redesigned magnetic connector for accessories like the Smart Keyboard located on the rear of the iPad. At this point an official iPad reveal can’t be too far off — the biggest question is whether Apple will choose to hold an October event this year, as it does semi-regularly. Almost the entire Mac lineup is also overdue a refresh, so the company could have a lot to announce."

That includes the white, black, and new pink “sand” option, which first leaked last week:  For the sake of completeness. pic.twitter.com/eC4shkx613 Blass also got his hands on an image of the upcoming Pixel Slate tablet, which happened to leak first over the weekend:  There's more to life than phones. pic.twitter.com/qRyuwbNKWA Over at 9to5Google, more images of the full retail box and packaging were leaked on Sunday. The publication also got its hands on images of an operating version of the retail phone, including its settings screen and a list of installed apps. The retail version of the Pixel 3 leaked in full last week when the device was sold prematurely by a retailer in Hong Kong, with Engadget having been fortunate enough to get its hands on the device early.  One final leak, also from 9to5Google, includes a significant chunk of information about the new AI-powered camera features on the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL. According to the report, two new modes called Top Shot and Photobooth will use software to pick out the best photos and selfies taken with the camera. Top Shot will work by taking a burst of photos before and after you press the shutter and picking the best one, while Photobooth will analyze photos you take of either yourself or others and pick out the ones it thinks are the most photogenic.  Other camera features that leaked include a new zoom option called “super res zoom” that could use AI to fill in detail when zooming in close to a subject using the Pixel 3, although we don’t have a lot of concrete information on that yet, 9to5Google notes. There will also reportedly be a subject-tracking focus mode, so you don’t have to re-focus the Pixel 3 camera by tapping the screen.  Of course, this information and all the details regarding the new hardware, which is said to include a third-generation Chromecast and the new Pixel Slate tablet, will be revealed in full tomorrow. So much of what’s leaked or rumored could change slightly in the final marketing material. That said, we now have quite an unprecedented level of knowledge about this Google hardware event ahead of time, leaving very little room for surprises. "
VERGE,Motorola’s Moto E5 comes to the US for $100,10/08/18,https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/8/17953116/moto-e5-us-launch-price-release-date-specs," Motorola has brought the Moto E5 to the US, after launching two variants of the phone — the E5 Plus and E5 Play — earlier this year. The E5 is the cheapest of the three models, but it actually looks the most modern from the outside. It has an 18:9 display with somewhat trimmed down bezels on the front, a relatively slim profile, and a fingerprint sensor on the back. It’s selling for just $100, and you don’t always check all those boxes at that low price point. Of course, as a $100 phone, there are some tradeoffs on the specs. You get a big 5.7-inch display, but at a resolution close to 720p — low for that large of a size. It also doesn’t have a water-repellant coating, like the other E5 models.

   But if those tradeoffs are fine with you, the specs here are in line what you should see in a $100 phone. It has a Snapdragon 425 processor, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of storage (expandable by Micro SD), a headphone jack, and NFC for mobile payments. There’s even one big perk here: a large 4,000mAh battery, which should easily make it through a day. It comes running Android Oreo. This isn’t one of Motorola’s best values — if you’re able to spend more, the Moto G6 line provides more power and nicer parts But the Play and Plus both performed well when I tested them out earlier this year, and it’s likely the E5 will do the same, which could make it one of the better options at the $100 price point. Update October 9th, 10:35AM ET: Motorola says that the E5 does include support for 5GHz Wi-Fi, despite initially listing it as only a 2.4GHz device. This story has been updated to remove a line pointing out the absence."
VERGE,Asus announces midrange Chromebook with 14-inch touchscreen,10/08/18,https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/8/17953062/asus-14-inch-google-chromebook-c423," Asus quietly announced a new 14-inch Chromebook today, the C423. There’s no pricing information yet, but it’s a midrange Chromebook that comes in two variations: a non-touchscreen one that’s powered by an Intel Celeron processor, and one with a 1080p touchscreen display that’s powered by a Pentium N4200. The company claims this model is the first of its Chromebooks to feature a “NanoEdge design,” which means it’s got some pretty thin 5.8mm bezels. The 180-degree hinge lets the Chromebook lay flat, and it’s been “subjected to a grueling 20,000-cycle open-and-close test to ensure long-term reliability,” the marketing materials say.  The battery should last around 10 hours, and the device thankfully charges through a USB-C port. The C423 also features USB 3.1 ports, and a microSD slot. At 16.1mm thickness in an aluminum-finished body, it’s just a hair thicker than HP’s new Chromebook x360 14, which was also announced today."
VERGE,"Apple seeks deal with UK telecom to sell Apple TVs, says report",10/08/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17951784/apple-tv-bt-uk-telecom-ee," Apple is attempting to expand the reach of its Apple TV, according to a report today from The Telegraph. The US company is reportedly in talks with UK telecom provider BT and its mobile offshoot EE to give customers the option to purchase an Apple TV that comes pre-loaded with BT’s pay-TV channel apps. The company is said to be looking at EE because of its younger user demographic. This partnership would obviously benefit both companies — Apple gets access to more hardware customers and BT can directly appeal to that same group. Reports that Apple is trying to launch its own streaming service have circulated for a long time. The company has ordered multiple shows that have seemingly nowhere to air. It signed a multiyear agreement with Oprah Winfrey, ordered a pair of children’s shows from the creators of Sesame Street, a reboot of the science fiction anthology show Amazing Stories, a Hunger Games-style dystopian show called See, and a series from La La Land director Damien Chazelle.  It’d make sense that Apple would want to get into as many households as possible, if it ever plans to offer an Apple TV app for these programs."

The IOS 12.0.1 update is available to download now in Settings —> General —> Software Update on your iPhone or iPad. The update should fix one of the biggest issues on the iPhone XS and XS Max: users reported poor Wi-Fi reception compared to their previous iPhone X devices when used in their homes, but it doesn’t address the separate LTE issues. It also resolves the widespread issue of iPhone XS devices requiring to be unlocked before recognizing the Lightning cable charger. There’s also a slightly lesser-known issue with the iPad keyboard that’s being fixed. You can see the full release notes for the software update below. "
VERGE,Google is shutting down Google+ for consumers following security lapse,10/08/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17951890/google-plus-shut-down-security-api-change-gmail-android," Google is going to shut down the consumer version of Google+ over the next 10 months, the company writes in a blog post today. The decision follows the revelation of a previously undisclosed security flaw that exposed users’ profile data that was remedied in March 2018. Google says Google+ currently has “low usage and engagement” and that 90 percent of Google+ user sessions last less than five seconds. Still, the company plans to keep the service alive for enterprise customers who use it to facilitate conversation among co-workers. New features will be rolled out for that use case, the company says. Google is focusing on a “secure corporate social network,” which is odd considering this announcement comes alongside news that the company left profile details unprotected. In addition to sunsetting Google+, the company announced new privacy adjustments for other Google service. API changes will limit developers’ access to data on Android devices and Gmail. Developers will no longer receive call log and SMS permissions on Android devices and contact interaction data won’t be available through the Android Contacts API. That same also API provided basic interaction data, like who you last messaged, and that permission is also being revoked.  As for the Gmail changes, the company is updating its User Data Policy for the consumer version of the email service. This will limit apps and the scope of their access to user data. Ben Smith, Google fellow and VP of engineering, writes: “Only apps directly enhancing email functionality — such as email clients, email backup services and productivity services (e.g., CRM and mail merge services) — will be authorized to access this data.”  Any developer who has this access will have to undergo security assessments and agree to new rules about data handling, like not transferring or selling user data for targeting ads, market research, email campaign tracking, or other unrelated purposes. Google previously tried to quell privacy concerns earlier this year after The Wall Street Journal detailed how common it is for third-party app developers to be able to read and analyze users’ Gmail messages. At the time, Suzanne Frey, the director of the company’s security, trust, & privacy division of Google Cloud, emphasized that users should review what apps have access to their accounts and revoke it if necessary. Last year, Google announced that it would stop its long-standing practice of scanning the contents of individual Gmail users for advertising purposes. Of course, the company still has plenty of data it can target advertisements against, like Search history, YouTube views, and other Chrome actions. These most recent changes are being attributed to an internal Google effort called Project Strobe, which involved a review of “third-party developer access to Google account and Android device data and of our philosophy around apps’ data access,” according to Google."
VERGE,Google hid major Google+ security flaw that exposed users’ personal information,10/08/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17951914/google-plus-data-breach-exposed-user-profile-information-privacy-not-disclosed," Google exposed the personal information of hundreds of thousands of users of its Google+ social network, the company announced in a blog post this morning. The news, originally reported by The Wall Street Journal ahead of Google’s announcement, means that Google+ profile information like name, email address, occupation, gender, and age were exposed, even when that data was listed as private and not public. However, Google says that it has no evidence to suggest any third-party developers were aware of the bug or abused it. The bug, affecting an API that was accessed by hundreds of developers, appears to have been active between 2015 and 2018.  The company says it closed the bug in March 2018 shortly after learning of its existence. The WSJ reports that the company chose not to report it because of fear of “immediate regulatory interest” that would lump Google in with Facebook, according to one source’s description of the incident. At the time, Facebook had just publicly disclosed that data mining firm Cambridge Analytica had illegally purchased tens of millions of users’ profile information from a third-party app maker, who had gleaned that information from people who logged into a personality quiz and inadvertently granted the app access to their friends list.  Google says it discovered the bug as part of an effort called Project Strobe, which was launched to “review of third-party developer access to Google account and Android device data and of our philosophy around apps’ data access,” according to Ben Smith, the blog post author and a vice president of engineering. As a result of the breach, the company is shutting down the consumer-facing element of Google+, noting that 90 percent of sessions lasted less than five seconds. About 500,000 user profiles were affected by the breach, Smith notes.  In the post, Smith gives a rationale for not disclosing the bug earlier:  Every year, we send millions of notifications to users about privacy and security bugs and issues. Whenever user data may have been affected, we go beyond our legal requirements and apply several criteria focused on our users in determining whether to provide notice. Our Privacy & Data Protection Office reviewed this issue, looking at the type of data involved, whether we could accurately identify the users to inform, whether there was any evidence of misuse, and whether there were any actions a developer or user could take in response. None of these thresholds were met in this instance. The Google+ shutdown will take place over the course of the next 10 months, concluding in August of 2019. It still plans to make Google+ available as an enterprise product for companies, which is a curious move for a product that had a massive, exploitable bug built into a core API for three years. “We’ve decided to focus on our enterprise efforts and will be launching new features purpose-built for businesses. We will share more information in the coming days,” Smith writes.  Update 10/8, 2:45PM ET: Added Google’s rationale for not disclosing the bug earlier. "
VERGE,Google escapes billion-dollar privacy lawsuit in the UK,10/08/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17951774/google-safari-workaround-uk-high-court-lawsuit-thrown-out," The UK’s High Court of Justice has blocked an attempt by a campaign group to sue Google for allegedly tracking millions of users without their consent, reports BBC News. The group, “Google, You Owe Us,” claims that as many as 5.4 million users were affected by Google’s tracking between August 2011 and February 2012, and sought around £1 billion ($1.3 billion) in damages from the search giant.  Google has already gotten into trouble as the result of the so-called “Safari Workaround,” which ignored user’s cookie settings within the Safari browser to track them regardless. Back in 2012, the company paid a $22.5 million fine to the FTC for “[misrepresenting] to Safari browser users how to avoid targeted advertising by Google.” At the time, the fine was the largest ever levied by the FTC.  Despite this, it still wasn’t possible to proceed with the case in the UK, even as the justice who oversaw the case admitted that “arguably” Google’s alleged role “was wrongful, and a breach of duty.” Although the data gained could have potentially allowed Google to make more money with better targeted ads, it’s impossible to say how much the affected users were actually damaged — although Google You Owe Us claims the damage amounted to £750 (around $980) per person. The campaign group has said that it plans to appeal the ruling on behalf of the 20,000 people who signed up. Meanwhile, Google said it was “pleased” to see the court dismiss the claim, although it added that the privacy and security of its users is “extremely important” to the company.   "
VERGE,"Google Slides is adding live captions to its presentations, just like PowerPoint",10/08/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17950380/google-slides-closed-captions-real-time-transcription-g-suite-accessibility," As part of Accessibility Awareness Month, Google is adding a new captioning feature to its G Suite presentation app Slides. The feature uses a computer’s built-in microphone to automatically transcribe the speaker’s words and display them in real time as subtitles on the slide being presented. The feature is intended primarily to help deaf and hard of hearing audience members, but should also improve the experience for anyone that understands written English better than spoken.  Powerpoint has offered similar, but more robust functionality for more than a year now. Microsoft’s service makes use of its Translator live feature to translate the spoken presentation into as many as 60 different languages and transmit them directly to attendees phones. Google’s captioning feature is only available in US English for now, but will be available globally to anyone using Slides via Chrome on desktop or a laptop starting this week. To activate it, click the “CC” button in the navigation box when you begin presenting, or else use press Ctrl + Shift + C in Windows or Command + Shift + C on a Mac. "
VERGE,Microsoft now faces a big Windows 10 quality test after botched update,10/08/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17951298/microsoft-windows-10-bugs-issues-report," Microsoft has pulled its latest Windows 10 update offline after some users complained of missing files. It’s the latest in a string of incidents with regular patches and Microsoft’s larger Windows 10 updates that have been causing issues for some PC users this year. While Microsoft tests Windows 10 with millions of beta testers, there are signs that this public feedback loop isn’t always working. Earlier this year Microsoft delayed its April 2018 Windows 10 update due to last minute Blue Screen of Death issues, and then had to fix desktop and Chrome freezing issues after it was shipped to more than 600 million machines.  Microsoft now faces questions over how these updates have caused big issues, and why the company didn’t pick them up in testing. These questions are especially relevant as it appears Microsoft was warned about both of these major bugs before the company shipped the April and October 2018 updates. Reports of the desktop freezing bug were submitted multiple times by testers earlier this year, but don’t appear to have been flagged as a bigger problem because they weren’t up voted.  Likewise, the recent data deletion issue was flagged in feedback reports from months before Microsoft released the October 2018 Update last week. It’s still not clear how many are affected by this current issue, but it’s enough to have forced Microsoft to pull the update entirely — an unusual step for the company. Microsoft’s big change for Windows 10 was listening to its customers after the Windows 8 disaster. Instead of developing the operating system behind closed doors, the company opened it up for everyone to test early access to builds and help report issues. It was a daunting prospect for then-Windows chief Terry Myerson, who admitted in a 2015 interview with The Verge that “you’re putting it out there when it’s not done, then you’re getting all kinds of feedback and stuff that you know is broken.” Microsoft may have been relying on its Windows Insider program too much for Windows 10, though. Microsoft largely phased out its dedicated Software Test Engineer (STE) roles for Windows during a huge round of layoffs a year ahead of the Windows 10 release. Instead, it has favored developers testing their own work, or reports from the Windows Insider feedback program. Hal Berenson, who spent years working at Microsoft as a distinguished engineer, believes there are three possibilities for this latest data deletion bug shipping to the public. “(1) They couldn’t isolate the problem and decided it was rare enough to ship anyway. (2) Automated filtering tools failed to catch that this was a serious issue despite rarity. (3) They put in a fix, but it didn’t fix all cases,” says Berenson in tweet. “My actual vote is on #3, because I’ve seen that happen many times in my career.” Microsoft has not yet revealed exactly why this deletion bug made it into the Windows 10 October 2018 Update, but it’s unlikely the company ever will. A support article reveals Microsoft is investigating “isolated reports” of documents going missing after the Windows 10 October 2018 Update is installed. Microsoft’s Windows Insider chief, Dona Sarkar, says affected users should call Microsoft’s support line as the company has “the tools to get you back to a good state.” Either way, it’s not a good look for Microsoft’s Windows 10 feedback program. Microsoft was bold in its move to allow anyone to test Windows 10, but it now needs to recognize some of these issues with Windows software quality. Windows 10 is also facing a number of issues related to regular monthly security update patches, and those even forced enterprise patching veteran Susan Bradley to write an open letter to Microsoft earlier this year.  The company’s response to these issues is now a big test for Windows 10, which has been generally well received. If Microsoft is truly listening to customers then now is the time to prove it."
VERGE,Read Apple’s letter to Congress denying spy chip report,10/08/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17951174/apple-amazon-spy-chip-china-microchip," Apple has come out swinging at last week’s Bloomberg spy chip report today with a new letter to some of the biggest tech watchdogs in Congress, flatly denying that any of the company’s servers were compromised through the use of microchips implanted by Chinese spies. The letter, which was previously reported but recently made publicly available, assumes the same tough stance on the Bloomberg report that the company took on when it came out with its first press release last week. “Apple has never found malicious chips, ‘hardware manipulations’ or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any server,” wrote Apple’s vice president of information security George Stathakopoulos to the Senate Commerce and House Energy and Commerce Committees. “We never alerted the FBI to any security concerns like those described in the article, nor has the FBI ever contacted us about such an investigation.” Congress has been relatively quiet following the release of the report. Only a few have stepped up to make generalized statements condemning the potential threat of Chinese hardware to US national security. The Department of Homeland Security put out a statement Saturday evening backing both Apple and Amazon saying, “We have no reason to doubt the statements from the companies named in the story.” The UK’s top cyber security agency, the GCHQ, voiced the same sentiments on Friday.  Stathakopoulos said that he would make himself available for a briefing with the committee later this week. “If any of the reported details ... were true, we would have every interest—economic, regulatory, and ethical—to be forthcoming about it,” he wrote.

VERGE,T-Mobile promises 5G for its Metro prepaid service in 2019,10/08/18,https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/8/17950916/t-mobile-5g-metro-prepaid-2019," T-Mobile announced it was building out its 5G network in 30 cities this February, and today, the company committed to bringing 5G service to its Metro prepaid service in 2019, as first reported by CNET. Metro is the recently rebranded MetroPCS, which was acquired by T-Mobile in 2013. Metro’s unlimited plans are also launching today, which bring perks like Google One cloud storage and an Amazon Prime membership. The announcement is part of rebranding efforts to bring the budget prepaid service closer to its parent company T-Mobile’s premium features.  Carriers have been racing to be the first to deploy a 5G wireless network, in order to prepare infrastructure for self-driving cars and phones that’ll be able to support 5G in the future. But most of it appears to be marketing-speak, like how AT&T once used the term “5G Evolution” to just describe faster 4G LTE speeds. And just last week, as Verizon became the first major ISP to launch its 5G home internet service in four US cities, T-mobile CEO John Legere criticized the service in a tweet, saying, “It doesn’t use global industry standards or cover whole blocks and will never scale… but hey, it is first, right?!” T-Mobile is currently in the midst of a merger with Sprint, a strategic partnership designed specifically to use Sprint’s mid-band 2.5GHz spectrum for a stronger 5G network. T-Mobile also signed a $3.5 billion deal with Nokia this past July, which is helping build a longer-range, lower-frequency 600 MHz and 28 GHz millimeter wave spectrum for its 5G network."
VERGE,HP’s latest convertible Chromebook starts at $599,10/08/18,https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/8/17951212/hp-chromebook-x360-14-release-date-price-news-features," The HP Chromebook x360 14 is a convertible laptop running Google’s lightweight ChromeOS operating system. HP is advertising that this is the thinnest Chromebook it’s ever produced at just 16mm thick. Depending on your budget, its size won’t limit its power, with your choice of either an 8th Generation Intel i3 or i5 processor. That’s paired with 8GB RAM and 64GB SSD, so this device shouldn’t struggle with light workloads.  Despite how thin the chassis is, you’re still getting a decent array of ports. There are two USB Type-C ports, a standard sized USB Type-A port, and a microSD slot. The battery isn’t too shabby either, with HP promising that it should last as long as 14 hours on a single charge, although you’re only getting a Full HD display.  Although it appears to be a laptop first and tablet second, the HP Chromebook x360 14 comes as Google appears increasingly to be positioning ChromeOS as its tablet operating system of choice rather than Android. Google itself is expected to launch a ChromeOS tablet alongside the Pixel 3 later this week, although this will reportedly feature a removable keyboard rather than a hinge that tucks the keyboard away like the x360 has.  The HP Chromebook x360 14 will be available on October 21st starting at $599. You can preorder it later today from either Best Buy or HP directly. "
VERGE,"Intel announces its latest 9th Gen chips, including its ‘best gaming processor’ Core i9",10/08/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17950968/intel-9th-gen-core-chips-2018-desktop-processors-8-core-i9-9900k," Intel’s next generation of desktop processors are here with the company announcing its new 9th Gen Core chips today at its fall hardware event.  To that end, Intel revealed its new Core i9-9900K, which Intel says is “the best gaming processor in the world. Period.” The i9-9900K offers eight cores and 16 threads, clocked at base frequency of 3.6 GHz, which can be boosted up to 5.0 GHz. Along with the new Core i9 processor, Intel is also announcing new 9th Gen Core i5 and Core i7 models, too: the i7-9700K with eight cores and eight threads, and base 3.6 GHz clock speed (which can be boosted to 4.9 GHz); and the i5-9600K, which offers six cores and six threads at a base 3.7 GHz speed (which can be boosted up to 4.6 GHz). Despite Intel jumping ahead to its 9th Gen moniker, the new chips are still based off Intel’s existing 14nm process, which the company has been using as far back as the 5th Gen Broadwell chips back in 2014. The 9th Gen chips are specifically using Intel’s 14nm++ process that it introduced last year with its 8th Gen Coffee Lake chips, with Intel continuing to delay production of its truly next-gen 10nm Cannon Lake chips until 2019. Intel also notes that these are its first desktop processors to have hardware fixes for the Meltdown Variant 3 and L1 Terminal Fault issues, with the remaining protections done through software. Preorders for the 9th Gen chips open today, with the processors set to ship on October 19th. The chips are priced far more modestly than Intel’s pricier Core X, too: the Core i9-9900K is set to cost $488, the i7-9700K will cost $373, and the i5-9600K will set you back $262. But Intel isn’t leaving out its high-end users, either: the company also announced an updated lineup of its Core X-Series processors (first announced in 2017), with new Core i7 X-Series, Core i9 X-Series, and Core i9 Extreme processors that are built on Intel’s 14nm++ process (but still based on the Skylake X design.) And like the first-generation Core i9 Extreme, the new model continues to offer 18 cores and 36 threads — remaining at the top of Intel’s consumer range. Intel announced seven new Core X chips today, set to release sometime in November. Those include the Core i9-9980XE — the aforementioned 18 cores / 36 threads Core i9 Extreme model — which has a maximum turbo-boosted clock speed of 4.5GHz and will cost $1,979. There also five regular Core i9 X-Series chips, ranging from the 16 core / 32 thread $1,684 Core i9-9960X, to the 10 core / 20 thread $889 Core i9-9820X, and a base Core i7-9800X model with eight cores and 16 threads for $589. And for professional users who need even more firepower, Intel announced a new 28 core and 56 thread unlocked Intel Xeon W-3175X processor. Base clock speed is 3.1 GHz, boosted up to 4.3GHz and it’s set to ship later this year in December. No price has been announced yet, but it likely won’t be cheap when it does hit stores."
VERGE,"Microsoft’s xCloud service streams Xbox games to PCs, consoles, and mobile devices",10/08/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17950878/microsoft-xcloud-game-streaming-xbox-games-features," Microsoft is unveiling its game streaming service for the first time today. Dubbed Project xCloud, it’s designed to work across consoles, PCs, and even mobile devices. “Scaling and building out Project xCloud is a multi-year journey for us,” explains Microsoft’s cloud gaming chief Kareem Choudhry. “We’ll begin public trials in 2019 so we can learn and scale with different volumes and locations.” Microsoft has built custom hardware for its datacenters, as The Verge previously exclusively reported, so that existing and future Xbox games will be compatible with the services. Games will be streamed to devices, and Microsoft has been testing the xCloud service with Xbox wireless controllers connected to consoles, mobile devices, and PCs. Microsoft says its research teams are “creating ways to combat latency” via advanced network techniques combined with video encoding and decoding. This should make game streaming viable on 4G networks, too.  Public trials of the service will begin next year, and Microsoft’s Xbox game streaming service will face competition from a variety of existing services. The most popular include GeForce Now, PlayStation Now, Shadow, and Liquid Sky. Microsoft’s xCloud unveiling comes just days after Google announced its own Project Stream service that will let testers play Assassin’s Creed Odyssey through its Chrome browser on a laptop or desktop. Microsoft isn’t revealing exactly what it’s doing differently than the competition, but we’ll find out more details when public testing starts in 2019."
VERGE,The HyperX Cloud Mix wants to be your gaming headset and wireless headphones rolled into one,10/08/18,https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/8/17950758/hyperx-cloud-mix-bluetooth-gaming-headset-release-date-price-features," HyperX has announced its first Bluetooth headset. Called the Cloud Mix, the headset’s use of the universal Bluetooth standard means that it will pair just as easily (or clumsily, as in the case of most Bluetooth connections) to your smartphone as it will to your PC. With an internal microphone in addition to the detachable mic arm, the Cloud Mix has a shot at avoiding the gamer-y look that stops most people from using gaming headsets as standalone wireless headphones. The Cloud Mix isn’t HyperX’s first wireless headset, but its pre-existing Cloud Flight relied on a USB dongle to connect to your machine wirelessly. Gaming headset manufacturers have previously relied on these dongles to reduce latency and offer cross-compatibility between PC and consoles. We haven’t had a chance to try out the Mix yet to see how responsive it is, but the change means you’ll need to use it in wired mode if you want to use it with a console.  Playback time is rated for 20 hours, which is about average for a pair of wireless headphones in 2018. Once that power’s gone, you’ll be charging them over Micro USB — no USB Type-C here, unfortunately.  Even if it doesn’t do everything perfectly, the Cloud Mix has the advantage of working in so many different situations that it might not end up mattering. The headset is available now in the US for $199.99.   "
VERGE,Alcatel’s newest budget tablet is designed to be left with children,10/08/18,https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/8/17950338/alcatel-3t-8-lte-tablet-release-date-price-specs-features-kids-mode," The Alcatel 3T 8 is the budget brand’s latest eight-inch tablet. With a sub-Full HD screen, a midrange processor, and 2GB of RAM, this Android Oreo device isn’t a powerhouse. Instead, it’s a device that’s designed to be left in the hands of children, and comes with a budget price tag of $150 that should prevent you from getting too precious about it.  There’s Kids Mode software built directly into the tablet for example, which allows you to block or impose time restrictions on apps beyond the parental controls already provided by Android. A 4080mAh battery comes with a promise of a bit more than eight hours of continuous streaming over Wi-Fi, or seven if you’re on LTE. Meanwhile, a CloserTV app amalgamates your cable, satellite TV, and streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Video into one place. The Alcatel 3T 8 will be available exclusively from T-Mobile starting October 12th.  "
VERGE,"Facebook announces Portal, an Echo Show rival focused on video chat",10/08/18,https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/8/17928554/facebook-portal-announced-camera-price-video-chat," As Facebook works to contain the fallout from its biggest-ever data breach, the company is introducing a product that will bring a camera and microphone into your living room. Facebook Portal, and the larger Portal Plus, are smart displays that are laser-focused on video chatting.  The first hardware products marketed under the Facebook brand, the Portals can be used to call other Portal users, or anyone who has Facebook or Facebook Messenger. The Portals can play music through Spotify and Pandora, or stream video from Facebook Watch, but these are intentionally limited devices. For better and for worse, you can’t even browse Facebook. The smaller Portal closely resembles Amazon’s Echo Show, while the bigger one looks like something that would take your order at a fast food restaurant. The larger Portal Plus stands out wherever you put it, and would probably work best in a living room, while the regular Portal would more easily blend into your kitchen, like a countertop TV. The Portal is designed to simplify video chatting by having a wide-angle camera capable of identifying your body, then tracking you as you move around the room. It makes for more comfortable chatting than holding a phone up to your face for extended periods of time. Facebook says the Portal is designed to create the sense that you’re sharing one big room with the people you’re talking to, and considers the chats you have on the device an augmented reality experience. With the Portal, you don’t have to hold, aim, or direct anything. Once a chat starts up, the device’s camera will automatically find people in the room and keep them in frame. If multiple people are in a room, the camera will use a wide angle to fit them all. If there’s only one person, the camera will zoom in to focus on their face. Facebook says this feature makes video chatting more natural, since you can just talk without worrying about camera angles. The button on the left deactivates the mic and camera. Still, the idea of putting a Facebook-connected camera and microphone into your home is likely to give many consumers pause. A majority of Americans say they don’t trust the company very much or at all, and the Portal’s launch was delayed in hopes it could escape the long shadow of the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal. Facebook’s Portal team recognizes that they have a trust deficit with consumers. Both devices come with a camera cover, and they both have a button that completely turns off the mic and camera. Facebook says this doesn’t just deactivate the mic and camera, but physically cuts the circuit to prevent hacking attempts. “Those electronics are not accessible from the software, so you have to be physically on the device to connect it back again,” says Rafa Camargo, vice president of the Portal hardware team. Still, trust concerns are likely to dominate the initial reception of this device: even if the Portal provides an amazing chat experience, it has to overcome the many hurdles associated with the Facebook name. Camargo says Facebook attempted to “build privacy from the ground up and on every layer of the stack” when making the Portal. Many options on the device are opt-in, including a feature that lets other Portals see when you are actively using the device and are presumably more open to chatting. “We made certain choices that even now our trial users are saying ‘I want it,’” Camargo says. “But we made a choice not to offer certain things just to make sure people understood the focus on privacy on the device.” Facebook didn’t build any video recording features into the Portal, in hopes that people would trust the camera more. But the Portal also has an always-listening voice assistant for initiating calls, which needs to send voice data to Facebook’s servers to be processed. That’s all logged in your Facebook settings, too, and if you want to delete it you’ll have to do so manually. Despite the privacy concerns, what Facebook has made with the Portal isn’t all that different from Amazon’s Echo Show — in many ways, it’s less ambitious. The Echo Show debuted with a mode that lets you automatically start a video chat with a trusted contact. It came with no camera cover or deactivation button, either. If people can get past those concerns around Facebook, they’ll find a dedicated video chatting experience that’s easier than what they’re used to on a phone. In a short demo, the camera’s tracking worked as promised. As we moved around the room, the Portal camera tracked us so that we were never out of frame for the person on the other end. Facebook says it worked with an Oscar-winning cinematographer to figure out how the camera should pan and zoom; you can tell they put some thought into it, but the actual effect is closer to the lagging movements of an awards show camera operator trying to keep a person in frame as they walk up to the stage. It’s not bad, it’s just a funny effect to see inside your home. Beyond that, chat on the Portal works just like the video chat feature already built into Facebook. You can chat with multiple people at once and overlay goofy masks and effects. The Portal also includes some special features, including the ability to simultaneously play the same music for every Portal user in a video chat (so long as everyone has an account on the same music service). Facebook also built a “story time” mode that brings up a script on the storyteller’s Portal while displaying art and effects for the person on the other end. In a demo, we saw the storyteller’s face get overlaid with a Big Bad Wolf mask as they howled during a rendition of the fairy tale. Video chatting quality was surprisingly good — it still had the flat, sharpened look that accompanies every video chat, but looked better than the typical Facebook Messenger call. “Because we own the whole hardware stack, we invested a lot in both the video capture and compression technology,” Camargo says. Facebook is also using a more modern compression technology for voice and audio, which he says will come to Messenger eventually, as well. There’s little difference in the hardware between the two Portals. The smaller model has a 10-inch, 720p screen and two speakers. The larger model has a 15.6-inch, 1080p screen; two louder speakers; and a subwoofer, making it better for playing music. The Portal Plus also has the advantage of a rotating screen, which can switch between landscape and horizontal orientations while you’re chatting. When it’s idle, the device will scroll through Facebook photos from you and your friends. Facebook says it will only use photos from albums that you’ve selected or photos you’ve been tagged in. You can also use the device to watch shows on Facebook Watch or The Food Network. Then there are apps for Pandora, Spotify, iHeartRadio, and a news service called Newsy. Then there’s Alexa. Facebook gave up on making its own virtual assistant earlier this year, opting for a partnership model instead. Camargo said the Portal could add Google Assistant later, and the settings screen has a section labeled “assistants,” suggesting more are coming. And that’s it. Presumably more apps will come later, but Facebook isn’t yet opening up the platform to developers. That has its benefits: problematic political memes and misinformation are going to have a much harder time coming to the Portal than they do to the News Feed. But the limitations might also prove to be frustrating for users of the product. You can’t watch YouTube; there’s no web browser; WhatsApp and Instagram are nowhere to be found; and you can’t send or receive normal Facebook messages, even if they’re video recordings. If you buy the Portal, you have to really want to video chat with other people on Facebook, and do so from one room in your home, on something other than the phone or laptop or tablet that you likely already have. I use Facebook video chat a good deal with my fiancée when she travels, but I’ve only ever used it with her; my family uses FaceTime, and most of my friends would never pick up an unexpected video call. Facebook will start selling the Portal in November, with the smaller model selling for $199 and the Portal Plus selling for $349. Facebook will also be offering $100 off if you buy two at a time, and it seems to be hoping people will pick up a pair of Portals, then hand one to a relative they want to stay in touch with. Like much about the product, it’s not a bad idea — so long as you’re okay with it all being tied back to Facebook. Correction October 8th, 1:39PM ET: Due to an editing error, this article initially stated that the Portal’s voice assistant is “powered by Amazon’s Alexa.” Facebook developed its own voice assistant for initiating calls, and the two services run concurrently."
VERGE,Amazon Echo Show 2018 review: bigger screen and better sound aren’t enough,10/08/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17944022/new-amazon-echo-show-review-2018-alexa-speaker-video-camera," After being confined to an audio-only experience for over two years, Amazon’s Alexa assistant was finally given a screen with last year’s Echo Show, a blocky combination of a tablet-sized display and smart speaker. The original Echo Show was the first of its kind: a smart display, powered by an intelligent assistant, that could do more than just play music and set timers, it could show you the name of the song and the timer counting down, too. In the year and a half since, other assistants have gotten displays of their own. So now Amazon has released a new Echo Show, one that addresses some of the faults of the original and improves upon the idea, without completely reinventing it. The new Echo Show has a bigger screen, better speaker system, and a nicer design. It’s also running new software that’s prettier and easier to interact with, though the new software will also be coming to the original Echo Show when the new model arrives on October 11th. The new model comes with all of these features without commanding a higher price: it’s available for the same $229.99 that the first Show sold for at launch. Despite these improvements, the new Echo Show doesn’t do that much more than the prior model, and if anything, it highlights where Alexa’s boundaries are. When Alexa is restricted to a speaker, it’s easier to accept that Alexa is only really good at a handful of things, all of which rely on sound: weather reports, music, alarms, timers, etc. But when a large, bright screen is added to the mix, the expectations go up. A screen should let me watch video from any source I want, and it should be able to display information that’s relevant to me no matter where it comes from. Unfortunately, the new Echo Show’s bigger, better screen still doesn’t fulfill either of those expectations. That all makes the new Echo Show a bit frustrating: it’s better to look at, better to listen to, and nicer to use, but it still can’t do all of the things I reasonably expect a big, internet-connected display on my kitchen counter to be capable of. The most obvious upgrade with the new Echo Show is its new display. Amazon has expanded the screen from a cramped seven inches to a 10.1-inch panel. Instead of sitting atop a speaker grille, the new Show’s display takes up the entire front of the device, and it’s much nicer to look at as a result. The display is bright and vibrant, with rich colors and good viewing angles. It has a glossy glass cover, which means it can catch a bad glare at the wrong angle, but otherwise there’s nothing to complain about with it. For what the Show does and how it’s intended to be used, the new screen works well and is easier to use than the prior model’s display. The other obvious hardware upgrade is with the new Show’s speaker design. It still has two 2-inch speakers, but they’ve been moved from the front of the device to side-firing positions and have been upgraded with neodymium drivers for better quality sound. The new Echo Show also has a passive bass radiator for much better low-end response. The result of these design changes and speaker upgrades is a much better sounding device than before. The side-firing positioning of the speakers allows the Show to fill a room with sound much better than before. The more powerful speakers produce greater volume, and the passive radiator gives the Show some bass you can hear and sometimes feel, which was lacking in the old model. Is it as good as a Sonos One or another high-quality speaker? No, not quite, and at full volume the sound starts to fall apart and distort. But it’s good enough at normal listening volumes that when I swapped the out Sonos One in my kitchen for the new Show to do this review, I didn’t miss the Sonos. It also sounds better than the Lenovo Smart Display that runs the Google Assistant. I also like how the new Show looks on my kitchen counter more than the old model or Lenovo’s design. The first Show had a “chiseled out of a block of plastic” industrial vibe, while the fabric cover on the sides and the repositioned speakers give this new one a softer, gadget-that-can-live-in-your-home appearance. It also takes up less space on my counter than the Lenovo, while still giving me the same size display. Even with the greater volume and better sound output, the Show still was able to hear my voice commands without any problems, even from across the room. Still, there are things with the Show’s hardware design that will bother some. If you aren’t comfortable with an internet-connected camera staring at you all the time (there’s a 5-megapixel camera in the bezel just above the display), you can disable it in the Show’s settings, but there’s no hardware shutter switch to block it, like you can on Lenovo’s Smart Display. (Some double-sided tape and a googly eye work well, however.) It’s also still a big thing to have sitting on your counter all the time, and if you have a small kitchen with limited counter space, you might have a tough time making room for the Show. Unlike an iPad, you can’t easily put the Show in a drawer when you’re not using it. More significant than the new hardware is the new software that’s debuting with this Echo Show. Amazon says it spent the last year-plus learning how its customers used the Show in their homes and has designed the new software in response to that. There’s more customization, more ways to use touch to interact, more ways to control smart home gadgets and Alexa routines, and more things to do with the Show’s display than before. There’s even a web browser now. Even with these additions, the interface is still very familiar, and if you’ve been using an Echo Show for the past year, you’ll feel right at home with it. Most of the interactions are still driven by voice commands, but certain things can now be done by touch, such as turning on smart lights or running an Alexa routine. The web browser (you can choose between Amazon’s Silk browser or Firefox) is operated entirely with touch control, though amusingly, the only way to launch it is to ask Alexa to “open [Firefox or Silk]”. The home screen has more customization options and presents things like sports scores in a nicer fashion that before. Largely, it’s just prettier to look at, which is important for a device that will be sitting on your counter, shelf, or nightstand all the time, displaying headlines and other bits of information. Swiping down from the top of the screen displays three new options: Alarms, Lights & More and Routines, which let you, manage alarms, control individual or groups of smart lights and run Alexa routines you’ve set up in the mobile app without having to use your voice. It’s clever enough to put the most recently used smart light controls at the top of the list, so if you always use it to turn the lights on and off in your kitchen, you don’t have to scroll through the whole list every time. There still isn’t a grid of app icons, however, so many of the Show’s capabilities can feel hidden or hard to find. Amazon says there are now over 1,000 “skills” (the company’s equivalent of apps in the Alexa world) that take advantage of the Show’s display, and if you ask Alexa to “show me skills”, you can browse through a variety of categories, including ones that are specifically designed to use the screen. Most of the suggested skills are for displaying new facts or quotes every day, which is a bit underwhelming. In all, I find this whole process to be tedious and cumbersome, and most of my usage with Alexa is with its built-in capabilities, such as smart home control, shopping lists, timers, and music, not through third-party skills. There are other features that I don’t find very valuable. That 5-megapixel camera lets you video chat with other Echo Show devices or anyone that has the mobile Alexa app on their phone, but this feature isn’t particularly compelling in my day-to-day use. The Drop-In feature that lets you start a video call on the Show unannounced is still here and still kind of weird, though Amazon now lets you limit it to just the people on your Amazon Household. Should you decide to use these features, the Show’s fixed viewing angle can make it hard to find the right position for a video call, though the larger display does make it easier to see the other person. That said, there are certain things that I really like with the Show. My spouse and I use Alexa’s shopping lists to organize our grocery shopping and sync everything with our phones, and the Show’s display is great for seeing what’s already on the list and checking things off as necessary. I can even add a whole slew of items to the list with just one command (i.e. “Alexa add milk, eggs, bread, cereal, and Oreos to my list”) and Alexa is now smart enough to parse each one out into individual items. I’m not exaggerating when I say this is the new feature I’ve appreciated the most. The Show makes it very easy to manage multiple timers when you’re cooking, which you can individually label and watch as they count down without having to ask Alexa for an update on them. The Echo Show is also great for controlling smart home gadgets like lights and outlets. The new model now has built-in Zigbee support (just like the Echo Plus speaker), so you can use it as a central smart home hub and connect lights and other devices to it if you want. But all of these things also work great with a standard Echo or Alexa speaker, and none of them really justify the presence of the Show’s screen. For that, we need to see what the Show can do as a video player. The biggest drama with the original Echo Show was the ongoing disagreements between Amazon and Google over whether the device should be able to have YouTube or not. Amazon had originally included a specially designed YouTube experience for the Show that Google blocked, and then Amazon tried another approach that Google blocked yet again. So, Amazon went back to the drawing board and came up with a way to get YouTube on its Echo and Fire TV devices without the risk of Google blocking it: it installed a web browser on them. Using the Show’s built-in Amazon Silk or Firefox browsers, you can navigate to YouTube.com with the on-screen keyboard or a shortcut button and search for and watch videos that way. There are many issues with this experience. For starters, the Show’s browsers can only display the mobile version of the YouTube website, which looks ridiculous on the Show’s display. Video quality from the stream is poor and low resolution, and there’s no way to play YouTube videos with a voice command: you must type in all of your searches with the on-screen keyboard. You also can’t cast YouTube videos to the Show’s screen from your smartphone, like you can do with Lenovo’s Smart Display. Still, if you really want to watch YouTube videos on the Echo Show, you can now do so. I just don’t think I’ll ever want to go through the hassle. You can link your Hulu account or watch NBC (with a cable subscription) on the Show now, which gives it a couple of more video options. The Show can also work with Ring video doorbells to display who’s standing at your front door and allow you to have a two-way conversation with them. It will even announce when the bell has been rung. Unfortunately, the Hulu, NBC, and Ring integrations were not available for me to test in time for this review, but Amazon says they will be available when the Show ships to customers. There’s also new integration with Vevo, so you can request music videos to watch on the Show. But asking for specifics can be difficult (the Show refused to play the music video for “Shallow (A Star is Born)” by Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, no matter how I phrased my request), and there really isn’t a way to casually browse popular music videos. Amazon says that “Alexa’s ability to understand music video requests on Vevo is going through optimizations” and it expects this to be improved over time. The Show is also still lacking many other video sources, such as Netflix, HBO, Vudu, and over-the-top TV services like DirecTV Now and PS Vue. Aside from the Hulu and NBC integrations that are coming, the primary source of video content for the Show is still Amazon’s own Prime Video service, which while expansive and full of good content and exclusives, is still only one video source, and likely not the most watched one in your home. On top of all of that, much of the time, the Show feels frustratingly isolated from my phone. It’s much easier to search for things like videos and recipes on my phone, which I wish I could then push to the Show’s larger display. But the only thing I can cast from my phone to the Show is Amazon Music or Spotify music (via Spotify Connect). Amazon has established Alexa as one of the top-tier virtual assistants, and even if you don’t use most of Alexa’s features, you can still find it to be a very useful assistant for the few things you rely on it to do. The Echo Show is a similar proposition: you probably aren’t going to use all of its features, but you may find those few things that it does well that work in your life. For me, that’s managing a grocery list, controlling smart home gadgets, getting weather reports, and listening to music. But I’d love to use the Echo Show for other things, like watching the latest season of Big Mouth on Netflix while I do the dishes. Or use as a digital photo frame for my Google Photos account. The Show supports Amazon’s Prime Photos, naturally, but none of my photos are stored there. It’d be great if I could just cast Doug DeMuro’s latest deep dive on an exotic car on YouTube from my phone to the Show, so I can have it on while preparing lunch. Aside from perhaps Netflix, which Amazon potentially could add in the future, I probably won’t ever be able to use the Echo Show for all of the things I want to use it for, because at the end of the day, it’s mostly an access point for Alexa and not a full-fledged computer platform. Without deals with all of the video content providers, such as Netflix and HBO, and personal data storehouses, like Google and Apple, Alexa can feel a bit lonely. While I do not expect the Echo Show to do the exact same things as my phone — the thought of an email app and Twitter on the Show makes my eye twitch — I would like to be able to use the Show in conjunction with my phone, to either share information between them or remotely control either one. There certainly are pros to Amazon’s isolated, simplistic approach – my colleague Dieter Bohn appreciated the Show’s simplicity compared to a tablet or PC when he reviewed the first model over a year ago. And the Show is not alone in its limitations: Google’s Smart Displays have similar gates around what services they support and what features they have (and they don’t support Netflix either). The advantage Google has, however, is it already is a giant storehouse of my personal data, which Amazon is not. At the end of the day, if I’m going to commit to having an always-on, internet-connected screen sitting on my countertop all the time, I want it to do more than the Echo Show.

VERGE,OnePlus sets date for OnePlus 6T launch,10/08/18,https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/8/17950438/oneplus-6t-date-time-location," OnePlus has announced that the 6T, an enhanced version of the OnePlus 6 released earlier in the year, will be launching on October 30th at an event in New York City. The new model is expected to feature a tiny display notch and an in-display fingerprint sensor that’s responsible for the new handset’s “Unlock the Speed” tagline. Unfortunately, the 6T will see OnePlus drop the headphone jack for the first time, although it’s previously said that doing so will free up space for other technologies to be present in the device.  OnePlus is just the latest company to offer an in-display fingerprint scanner following the likes of Vivo, Xiaomi, and Huawei. The company’s tech requires you to place your finger on a specific part of the screen to work, but if that sounds too complicated then Face Unlock will be available as an alternative.  The 6T is also expected to see a dramatic reduction in the size of the display notch compared to the OnePlus 6. The size of the indent only leaves enough space for a front-facing camera, but should maximise the phone’s screen-to-body ratio.  The event kicks off at 11AM local time in New York City, so check back then for the full details."

VERGE,Apple’s latest Watch is crashing and rebooting due to Daylight Saving Time bug,10/08/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17950300/apple-watch-series-4-reboot-crash-dst-bug," Apple just can’t handle Daylight Saving Time (DST). 9to5Mac reports that Apple Watch Series 4 owners in Australia are experiencing crashes and reboots due to a DST bug. Apple’s latest watch reportedly gets stuck in a reboot loop due to a bug in the Infograph Activity complication. Australia just moved to DST and advanced its clocks by an hour yesterday, and this appears to be causing issues with Apple’s latest Series 4 Watch. As the watch gets stuck in a reboot loop, affected users can either wait it out until tomorrow when the bug should correct itself, or attempt to remove the complication from the Apple Watch app on the iPhone. The activity complication maps hour-by-hour data on calories burned, exercise time, and how many hours you’ve stood for in a 24-hour period. The missing hour appears to be confusing the Apple Watch Series 4. Europe moves off DST at the end of the month, and North America changes over on November 4th, so Apple has plenty of time to issue a fix for other regions. It’s entirely possible that the Apple Watch Series 4 might even handle the different DST (reversing an hour instead of advancing) in Europe and North America gracefully.  Either way, this is yet another DST bug for Apple. The company used to struggle with time-related bugs during the early days of iOS, causing alarms to fail across Europe, alarms simply not working on New Year’s Day, and the incorrect time being shown in the built-in calendar app. Even an iOS 9 update a few years ago managed to disable people’s alarms, and iOS 11.1.2 crashed iPhones when they hit 12:15AM on December 2nd last year. You’d expect all of these time bugs would put DST on the top of Apple’s engineer tests, but perhaps it’s Apple’s subtle way of telling the world that Daylight Saving Time is hot garbage."
VERGE,Apple tells Congress that it has found no sign of microchip tampering,10/07/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/7/17948924/apple-cybersecurity-microchip-george-stathakopoulos-denial-congress," Apple, Amazon, and Supermicro each released a forceful denial that their systems were tampered with following the publication of a Bloomberg Businessweek report last week, which alleged that Chinese agents introduced microchips into servers manufactured in the country. In a letter to Congressional officials, Apple reiterated its denial, saying that it has found no sign of tampering.  Reuters obtained a letter written by George Stathakopoulos, Apple’s Vice President for Information Security, which he sent to the commerce committees for both the US Senate and US House. In it, he says that “Apple’s proprietary security tools are continuously scanning for precisely this kind of outbound traffic, as it indicates the existence of malware or other malicious activity. Nothing was ever found.” He also reiterated that Apple hadn’t contacted the FBI over such an issue, as alleged in the report, and indicated that he would be available to brief Congressional staff in the coming days.   In its original statement, Apple said that while Bloomberg Businessweek asked the company to comment on the allegations in recent months, it “conducted rigorous internal investigations based on their inquiries” and hadn’t found any evince of tampering. Beyond each of the company’s respective denials, US and UK governmental agencies have backed them up, each saying that they have no any reason to doubt their statements. "
VERGE,A one-word Turing Test suggests ‘poop’ is what sets us apart from the machines,10/07/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/7/17940352/turing-test-one-word-minimal-human-ai-machine-poop," Imagine that you’re living in some dystopian future, and you have been accused of being an advanced AI, which is outlawed in this society. The penalty is death, and in order to convince the judge who will decide your fate, you can utter just one word, any word you like from the dictionary, to prove that you’re flesh and blood. What word do you choose?  It sounds like the setup for a cheesy sci-fi short, but this is actually part of a curious paper from a pair of researchers at MIT on something they call the “Minimal Turing Test.”  Instead of a machine trying to convince someone they’re human through conversation — which was the premise of the original Turing Test, outlined by British scientist Alan Turing in his seminal 1950 paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” — the Minimal Turing Test asks for just one word, either chosen completely freely or picked from a pair of words.  The researchers responsible, John McCoy and Tomer Ullman, clarify that the Minimal Turing Test isn’t a benchmark for AI progress, but a way of probing how humans see themselves in relation to machines. This question is going to become increasingly relevant in a world filled with AI assistants, deepfaked humans, and Google auto reply handling your email. In a world of human-like AI, what do we think sets us apart? What makes us different? In the first of McCoy and Ullman’s two tests, 936 participants were asked to select any word they liked that they thought could be proof of their humanity. Despite the free range of choices, results clustered around a small number of themes. The four most frequently picked words were “love” (134 answers), “compassion” (33 answers), “human” (30 answers), and “please” (25 answers), which made up a quarter of all responses. Other clusters were empathy (words like “emotion,” “feelings,” and “sympathy”), and faith and forgiveness (words like “mercy,” “hope,” and “god”).  All in all, the 936 answers covered 428 individual words, which is a striking amount of cohesion. In the second test, 2,405 participants had to choose between pairs of words, deciding which of the two they thought was given by a human and a machine. Again, words like “love,” “human,” and “please” scored strongly, but the winning word was simpler and distinctly biological: “poop.” Yes, out of all of the word pairings, “poop” was selected most frequently to denote the very essence and soul of humanity. Poop. Speaking to The Verge, McCoy of MIT’s Sloan Neuroeconomics Laboratory, stressed that the test was more about social psychology than computer science.  “We don’t see it being used as the next CAPTCHA,” McCoy says. “The practical applications it has in the AI computer space is more when you’re thinking about user interface design and things like that. In those contexts, it’s perhaps useful to know how people think about computers and what they think sets them apart.”  This makes sense, as even the original Turing Test has long fallen out of favor with computer scientists as a test of machine intelligence. Critics say that it tests the ability of programmers to find conversational hacks that can trick humans more than intelligence.  For example, in 2014, news coverage pronounced that the Turing Test had been passed by a chatbot. The programmers tricked judges by having their bot identify itself as a 13-year-old Ukrainian boy named Eugene Goostman. This provided the perfect cover for the bot’s many mistakes and its inability to answer certain questions. As critics like computer scientist Gary Marcus noted, “What Goostman’s victory really reveals ... is not the advent of SkyNet or cyborg culture but rather the ease with which we can fool others.” But this isn’t to say that the Turing Test is useless. Creating computer programs that can chat convincingly is a fruitful challenge for AI researchers that may benefit humanity. The test is also still a fantastic thought experiment that can help us explore complex questions surrounding our understanding of intelligence. We can also modify it to sharpen its focus by asking computers not to simply chat, but to answer queries that require a nuanced and rich understanding of the world. (One example is asking a computer, “What are the plurals of ‘platch’ and ‘snorp’?” A human would probably answer “platches” and “snorps,” despite the fact that these words are nonsense and can’t be found in a dictionary.) It’s in this framework that the Minimal Turing Test is best appreciated as a thought experiment, not a benchmark for AI progress. McCoy says what surprised him most about the research was just how much creativity there was in the answers. “People came up with all sorts of interesting shibboleths and puns,” he says, with words like “bootylicious” “supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.” (Try spelling that without Google.)  “It tells you something about the gap between humans and smart robots,” says McCoy, “that people who have never had to think about this situation before came up with a lot smart and funny results.” It’s something, in other words, that a computer would struggle with.

VERGE,Homeland Security backs Apple and Amazon’s denials of Chinese microchip hack,10/07/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/7/17947840/homeland-security-apple-and-amazons-denials-chinese-microchip-hack," Following last week’s bombshell report from Bloomberg Businessweek that claimed that Chinese spies infiltrated commercial servers in the US with hidden microchips, the Department of Homeland Security says that it has “no reason to doubt the statements from the companies named in the story.”  The statement concurs with what UK cybersecurity officials said on Friday: that they were aware of the reports, but didn’t have any reason to doubt Amazon and Apple’s forceful denials that their systems were compromised. DHS notes that it is aware of the report, and said that it recently launched several “government-industry initiatives to develop near- and long-term solutions to manage risk posed by the complex challenges of increasingly global supply chains.” Last week, Bloomberg Businessweek’s report cited current and former US Intelligence officials, who claimed that Chinese spies worked to place microchips into servers, allowing them access to systems. The report claims that Apple and Amazon discovered the microchips and reported them to US authorities. But both companies have denied the story. Cybersecurity experts have warned that such a threat does exist, and that it could be difficult to defend against. But in the wake of the report’s publication, skepticism has built as the companies involved, and government agencies have pushed back on its allegations.  "
VERGE,New images of Google’s Pixel Slate tablet show off a USB-C port and round keys,10/06/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/6/17946014/google-pixel-slate-tablet-leaked-image," Google’s Pixel 3 XL isn’t the only thing getting leaked ahead of the company’s big event next week: images of the company’s Pixel Slate tablet have also surfaced.  Rumors of Google’s first Chrome tablet have circulated in recent weeks. MySmartPrice posted several images of the device today, which show off the device using Chrome OS and a detachable keyboard. The site reports that it appears to have a 3:2 aspect ratio, comes with a pen, and features a pair of cameras, one in the front and the other at the back. It also features a USB-C port on the side, speakers on each side, and appears to be missing a headphone jack. Finally, MySmartPrice points to a pair of black sections on the back of the tablet, which they speculate could be for cellular connectivity.  Here's something fun: There's no sign of a headphone jack on Pixel Slate based on the renders that have leaked.  https://t.co/0O9FF3N0oH Pictures of the detachable keyboard differ from the images that leaked back in September from bluetooth keyboard manufacturer Brydge, which showed off a detachable keyboard with square keys and which connected to the tablet via Bluetooth. However, it’s possible that Brydge’s keyboard could be a mockup or third-party device, rather than one made by Google. This new set of images show off a keyboard with circular keys (which matches a short video from Chrome Unboxed from last month) that has a physical connector, and which features a dedicated Google Assistant key. In a separate leak, a tipster sent ChromeUnboxed (via 9to5Google) an image of the blue pen that appears in MySmartPrice’s report, which reportedly came from Google’s UK storefront as a recommendation alongside the existing white and silver models.  The convertible tablet appears to be aimed Apple’s iPad Pro and Microsoft Surface Pro tablets. The device is rumored to come in several configurations, with up to 16GB of RAM and an Intel i7 processor, and might come with a fingerprint sensor.  Google’s event is scheduled for Tuesday, October 9th at 11AM ET, where it’s expected to unveil the Pixel 3 phones and charging stand, the Slate tablet, the Google Home Hub, updates to the Pixelbook, Chromecast, and more, most of which has already been leaked.

VERGE,Google’s Pixel 3 XL is now being sold before its official launch,10/06/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/6/17945466/google-pixel-3-xl-sold-hong-kong-video-leak," Google will officially unveil its Pixel 3 at an event next Tuesday, but the device has already been thoroughly leaked in the last couple of weeks. Now, it appears that a Hong Kong retailer has already begun to sell the device, according to Engadget, which got its hands on a Pixel 3 XL.  Engadget editor Richard Lai obtained the device from a Hong Kong retailer, and it appears to be the real thing. The phone has been thoroughly leaked in the lead up its launch, showing off the screen, colors, wireless charging capabilities, cameras, and more. Lai put together a video review of the phone, noting that the device he has in hand matches up with the leaks that we’ve seen. The Pixel 3 XL in question has a 6.3-inch screen, 128GB of storage space, and Lai says that the screen looks good on a sunny day. The video also runs through the phone’s gestures and some of the specs: it uses Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 845 chipset, only has 4GB of RAM (he speculates that there might be a higher-end version with a bit more) and a 3,732mAh battery.  Engadget also checks out the phone’s cameras, finding that it has a 12.2-megapixel main camera, as well as a pair of 8-megapixel front-facing cameras, which allows it to take extra-wide shots.  Google will hold its Pixel 3 event on Tuesday, October 9th, starting at 11AM ET."
VERGE,Amazon fired an employee who shared customer e-mail addresses with a third-party seller,10/06/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/6/17945248/amazon-fired-employee-customer-email-addresses-third-party-seller," In September, Amazon confirmed that some of its marketplace sellers had bribed Amazon employees to delete negative reviews or to obtain proprietary information like sales data or customer e-mail addresses, following a report in The Wall Street Journal. Now, according to FT, Amazon has fired at least one employee.  FT says that the employee had provided customer e-mail addresses to a seller. Amazon confirmed the news, saying that “individual responsible for this incident has been terminated from their position, and we are supporting law enforcement in their prosecution.” The affected customers have since been notified, and Amazon says that no other customer information was leaked to outside parties.  One such affected customer forwarded the e-mail they received to The Verge, which notes that the employee has been dismissed, but also says that the third-party seller in question has been banned from Amazon’s marketplace. The customer noted that Amazon didn’t provide details on which third-party seller received their information. The WSJ’s report revealed that third-party sellers would use middlemen to locate Amazon employees, who in turn offered them money for internal information, in order to gain an edge against their competitors. Amazon noted that it was investigating and had put into place ““systems to restrict and audit what employees can access.” Updated October 6th 3:40 PM ET: Updated to include information provided by Amazon’s e-mail notifying customers of the incident.

VERGE,Talking to Master Replicas’ Hal 9000 smart speaker sent chills down my spine,10/06/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/6/17942878/master-replicas-hal-9000-2001-a-space-odyssey-new-york-comic-con-2018," “I’m sorry Dave, I’m afraid I can’t do that.” Even with the background hum of New York Comic Con all around us, the iconic voice of Hal 9000 — the sentient computer from the film 2001: A Space Odyssey — made me intensely nervous as its red eye stares back from Master Replicas’ booth on the convention floor.  Steve Dymszo, CEO for the prop-making company, leans in to speak over the noise of the crowd. “What’s the problem?” “I think you know what the problem is just as well as I do,” Hal responds. Dymszo gestures to the device. “You can go on and on with the rest of the sequence.”  Announced earlier this year in conjunction with the 50th anniversary of the iconic film’s release, the speaker system is an impeccable replica of the artificial intelligence’s hardware. It’s large, designed to be mounted on the wall, with Hal’s uncanny eye staring back at us. On the left is a series of buttons and screens that show off reproductions of screens from the film, showing off maps and docking sequences.  While it’s one thing to see the images released thus far of the prop device, it’s altogether another thing to have it parrot back the lines to you in that menacing voice, or to show off the sequence in which the AI kills off its human crewmates.  The product is designed as a home device that’s both prop replica and Bluetooth speaker system. Dymszo notes that while the system utilizes Alexa, it’s only able to parrot back the lines of the film; Amazon’s assistant hasn’t taken on the guise of its futuristic counterpart. But that could come someday down the line, and the device could be updated when that day comes.  The device on display at NYCC this weekend is the Command Console, and it includes the interactive screen. The company is only producing 2,001 models, and Dymszo notes that they’ve sold around 1,700 thus far. You can buy the removable Bluetooth speaker component — the tall rectangle with the eye mounted in the center — as a standalone device that you can pair your phone with, although that model doesn’t come with the interactive element. Even without it, having that red eye stare back at you is really something: and physically, it’s a far more interesting to look at than Amazon’s Echo Dot or Google’s Home. Mounting one on your wall would essentially be like having an Easter egg in your own home.  The company launched preorders for the device earlier this summer on Indiegogo (that campaign has since ended, but preorders have shifted to the company’s website) and Dymszo says that the device is currently being manufactured in China, and should be available in January 2019.

VERGE,How Facebook polarized us during the Kavanaugh hearings,10/06/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/6/17943680/facebook-polarization-kavanaugh-partisan-news-groups," The polarization of the American electorate predated Facebook’s arrival on the scene. But a nagging question about the social network has been whether its viral mechanics — and the viral mechanics on YouTube, Twitter, and other platforms — have accelerated the split between the left and the right. Today we have two stories that examine that phenomenon. The first concerns the fight over the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. At a time when the sharing of news articles on Facebook is in general decline, the wrenching battle over Kavanaugh has been a top performer on the site. And many of the top performing posts, reports Craig Silverman, are among the most partisan in nature: Daily Wire’s top story about Kavanaugh confirmation was published Oct. 1 with the headline “Prosecutor Who Questioned Ford Shreds Her Case In Five-Page Memo.” It’s generated more than 205,000 engagements. The site also received just under 180,000 engagements for the story, “Bill Clinton Rape Accuser Juanita Broaddrick Crashes Kavanaugh Hearing, Slams Dems For ‘Biggest Double Standard.’” [...] Occupy Democrats’ top story about Kavanaugh-Ford is headlined “Matt Damon just DESTROYED Kavanaugh and Senate Republicans in hilarious SNL cold open.” It had just under 70,000 engagements. Another story about the Kavanaugh confirmation, “Bernie Sanders just demanded the FBI investigate five lies Kavanaugh told at his hearing,” generated over 44,000 engagements. Silverman notes that more mainstream coverage, including from The New Yorker and CNN, outperformed these links. But the fight has thrown a lifeline to partisan publishers, who have struggled this year as Facebook ratcheted down the amount of news in the News Feed. It has replenished their email lists and generated new advertising revenues. And, in doing so, it has incentivized more polarized coverage in the future. Meanwhile, Facebook Groups are becoming more polarized … thanks to a simple name change. Kevin Roose tweeted about the phenomenonearlier in the week: “One of the largest pro-Kavanaugh groups on FB was previously called “ISIS SUPPORT GROUP” and “WHO FARTED? !!!!” Now the Washington Post’s Tony Romm has written a full account: The fluid nature of these groups illustrates how the social networking giant’s powerful tools for political and community organizing remain major risks for spreading misinformation and stoking unrest, especially as Facebook wages its war against inauthentic activity online and the 2018 election is just weeks away. Groups are at the heart of Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg’s stated mission to ensure “online communities strengthen physical communities,” as he put it during a speech in 2017. But group owners can easily rename and refocus their groups, while keeping their original members – and their ability to push content into their daily feeds. Facebook said in the last month it began displaying the two-year history of all groups’ name changes to improve transparency. The change offers “more information and insights about a Group, as well as increased accountability for Group admins,” said spokesman Andy Stone. With the Ford group, in particular, Facebook said late Thursday it is investigating its recent, whiplash revisions. On one hand, the groups in question here are small, with fewer than 10,000 members between them. On the other, they show how efforts to promote polarization are evolving along with the platform. Making it easy to change the name of the group also made it easy to take a general-interest group like, uh, “WHO FARTED,” and turn it into conservative stronghold. I imagine a Facebook employee might look at these two stories and respond: this is the biggest story in the United States right now. Of course it’s blowing up on social networks, and of course people are taking sides. But it’s still striking to see how fast, and how far, the shrillest of voices travel on the platform — and how a service meant to build community so often manifests itself as an engine for tribalism. Facebook’s Joel Kaplan admits mistake on Kavanaugh at intense company meeting Joel Kaplan, Facebook’s vice president of global public policy, told angry employees today that he had made a mistake when he went to support his friend Brett Kavanaugh during a hearing in which the Supreme Court nominee was accused of sexual assault. David McCabe, Mike Allen, and Kim Hart: A Facebook employee who viewed the event characterized the meeting as “intense,” and added that people were not expressing hostility but more incredulity at the situation. UK cyber security agency backs Apple, Amazon China hack denials Britain’s cyber security agency said Friday it had no reason to doubt Apple and Amazon after they challenged a Bloomberg report that their systems had been compromised by Chinese spies. Google CEO quietly met with military leaders at the Pentagon, seeking to smooth tensions over drone AI Sundar Pichai made an unannounced visit to the Pentagon during his Washington trip, Tony Romm and Drew Harwell report: Pichai met with a group of civilian and military leaders mostly from the office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence, the Defense Department directorate that oversees the artificial-intelligence drone system known as Project Maven, according to people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Smaller outlets reduce, scrap Facebook promotion over new ad rules Mathew Ingram reports that some news outlets are so reluctant to register as political advertisers that they’re halting Facebook advertising generally: Ultimately, Haussamen says, he stopped spending money on promoting content on Facebook. It wasn’t much money—maybe $70 or $80 a month—but the NMPolitics publisher said he thought it was an important symbolic move. Ironically, since he stopped spending money to promote posts, the amount of Facebook traffic to his site has been steady, while engagement on the site’s posts has actually gone up. “Whatever Facebook’s intent was, from my perspective, it has backfired on them completely,” he says. “I’m giving them less money and getting better engagement on their platform. It’s been a win-win.” The Last Jedi Russian troll study shows we still don’t know how to interpret speech online Earlier this week, several outlets — including The Verge — reported on a study claiming that Russian troll farms were responsible for inflaming tensions around The Last Jedi. Bijan Stephen and Adi Robertson revisited the study and talk to its author. It just doesn’t stand up to scrutiny: The paper doesn’t indicate an explicitly coordinated campaign to create an artificial political dispute. It suggests that a lot of real, individual humans decided to express genuinely held political views about a movie that they didn’t care much about. But the structure of the study also establishes these two categories as part of a single phenomenon of “deliberate, organized political influence measures,” or as the paper title puts it, “social media manipulation.” That’s a much more sweeping suggestion. The Journalist Who Blew Open The Cambridge Analytica Scandal Threatened To Injunct Channel 4 News And Demanded They Hand Over Their Sources Carole Cadwalladr gained fame as the face of the Cambridge Analytica coverage that rocked Facebook earlier this year. But behind the scenes, she was sending legal threats to the very journalists she was working with. A wild story from Mark DiStefano. Fake Facebook Profiles and Dating in Afghanistan Maija Liuhto has a charming story about how young people in Afghanistan are dating on Facebook. (And not by using Facebook Dating, either.) Until recently, dating was almost nonexistent in Afghanistan, because of religious and cultural norms that prohibit relationships before marriage. Communication was difficult too: During Taliban rule, people had to cross the border into Pakistan to make an international phone call (domestic calls weren’t easy either). Today, with the arrival of cheap smartphones and affordable mobile internet—about 90 percent of Afghanistan’s population has access to a cellphone—even the poorest people can get on Facebook. Althoughpremarital relationships are still taboo, social media have provided the younger generation with a covert means of online dating. “Boys usually use this technique to get closer to the girls they like,” says Naweed, an 18-year-old male student in Kabul who had a fake female Facebook profile for more than a year. (He asked to be identified by only his first name, because his family would not approve of him dating.) “I was talking to girls for fun, and I enjoyed it a lot.” Many men first try to friend their crushes using their real profile; if this fails, they resort to creating a fake account. Teens Are Nostalgic For 2015 And They’re Making Instagram Memes About It Surely this is one of the strangest effects of the Trump presidency: extreme short-term nostalgia. From a fun story by Julia Reinstein: Yes, 2015 was not that long ago. But most of these memers are teenage girls currently in high school. These were their formative preteen years. A teen who runs the account @glossberry told BuzzFeed News she thinks 2015 nostalgia has gotten big “because it is a relatable time for everyone” and “it’s not so far away that people don’t remember it.” Facebook Lite launches for iOS in Turkey These stripped-down versions of popular apps have grown popular over the past few years, but typically they’re only available on Android. (They’re designed for lower-income people using older phones.) But they often appeal to power users who prefer lighter-weight apps that aren’t as burdened by feature bloat — and that means iOS users. Facebook is now testing an iOS version of its own “lite” app in Turkey. (Anyone else think it would be fun to call this app Diet Facebook?) Introducing the Internet Bill of Rights Kara Swisher talks to Nancy Pelosi about Democrats’ plans to regulate the internet if they manage to take back Congress: The first principle, for example, covers an issue that seems dead obvious and should have been enshrined in law back in the early 2000s: The right “to have access to and knowledge of all collection and uses of personal data by companies.” (Some companies voluntarily follow this rule already, as well as a few of the following, but none are required by federal law.) The second says consumers should have to give their permission — an “opt in” rather than “opt out” system — before their data can be collected and shared with third parties. I like to call it the anti-Cambridge Analytica rule. The Dads of Pinterest Today’s social media hero is Neil Haldar, who is a member of my favorite new demographic: Pinterest dads: Neil Haldar, a divorced dad of a 15-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter, says the social network has been an invaluable parenting aid, especially since he lives in the Bay Area and his kids live in Bozeman, Montana, with their mom. When he visits them about once a month, he looks up recipes and projects on Pinterest that they can do together — from dinosaur-themed dioramas, to dry-ice volcanos, to no-bake key lime pies. He says it’s also been useful for travel planning and finding kid-friendly attractions. “I don’t have a guy friend where I can pick up the phone and be like, ‘Hey man, do happen to have an awesome recipe for a no-bake key lime pie?’” Haldar says. “So Pinterest has become my go-to in terms of what’s trending. Now, I have a place to go where I can search and get answers to questions that I feel like I’m a little behind on. That makes me a better dad.” Here’s to the good dads — the Pinterest dads.

VERGE,Microsoft pulls Windows 10 October 2018 Update due to major issues,10/06/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/6/17944966/microsoft-windows-10-october-2018-update-documents-deleted-issues-windows-update-paused," Microsoft has stopped distributing its latest Windows 10 October 2018 Update. The software giant started rolling out the update during the company’s Surface event earlier this week, but some Windows 10 users immediately noticed their documents were being deleted. “We have paused the rollout of the Windows 10 October 2018 Update (version 1809) for all users as we investigate isolated reports of users missing some files after updating,” says Microsoft on its support site for Windows Update.  Microsoft is now recommending that affected users contact the company directly, and if you’ve manually downloaded the October update then “please don’t install it and wait until new media is available.” Other Windows 10 users have been complaining that the Microsoft Edge browser and other store apps have been unable to connect to the internet after the October 2018 Update, and the update was even blocked on certain PCs due to Intel driver incompatibilities. It’s not clear how many Windows 10 users are affected by the problem, but even if it’s a small percentage it’s still surprising this issue was never picked up during Microsoft’s vast testing of the October update. Millions of people help Microsoft test Windows 10, but the company has struggled with the quality of Windows updates recently. Microsoft delayed its Windows 10 April 2018 Update earlier this year over Blue Screen of Death issues, but those problems were picked up before the update reached regular consumers and businesses.  Microsoft was planning to push the latest October update out to all Windows 10 users next Tuesday, but that’s now likely to be put on hold while investigations continue into this major deletion problem. Update, October 6th 6:50AM ET: Article updated with additional details on the October 2018 Update issues."

Now, a photo tweeted by YouTuber Jon Prosser appears to confirm the product with additional details about its capabilities. The photo gives some broad details about what the Home Hub can do. Its basic functions are similar to a Google Home speaker: you can voice-control compatible smart home components, like lights, security cameras, TVs, and speakers. It will also have Voice Match for recognizing different people’s voice commands to bring up their calendars, reminders, commute, and more on the home screen. Unlike a smart speaker, the Home Hub is supposed to deliver “visual, immersive answers” from Google when asked questions on things like the weather or local business info. It can also bring up relevant YouTube videos to watch on the Home Hub dashboard. Hey, speaking of @madebygoogle.Enjoy this ""leak"" straight from us. Was gonna wait until tonight's show, but f**k it.  ‍♂️ pic.twitter.com/Ez8A9obpCD This continues to confirm details that have already been leaked about the Home Hub. And, if this photo proves to be correct, the Home Hub will be available on October 22nd (at least in England, as pounds are referenced instead of dollars), and it will likely be announced at Google’s upcoming event on October 9th."
VERGE,View All,,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/5/17942838/apple-amazon-china-hack-servers-supermicro," According to an explosive report from Bloomberg, nearly 30 of the US’s top tech companies were infiltrated by Chinese spies by way of tiny, rice-sized microchips placed in their servers. Those chips allegedly opened up a backdoor for the Chinese government to gain access into some of the US’s most sensitive infrastructures. But the companies named in the piece, Amazon and Apple, denied the validity of any of the allegations. In unprecedented moves, both companies put out statements refuting the report’s individual claims. These statements weren’t the one-lined, vague sentiments they normally push out, but point-by-point refutations.  The report has taken the cybersecurity world by storm, and experts are picking apart both sides of the story. Members of Congress are starting to speak out, and some are even calling for an investigation into the details of what could be one of the most mind-boggling stories of the year."

However, for those who want to buy a Watch at an Apple Store, there might be a wait as only limited quantities are available. This version of the new Apple Watch has a few changes that separate it from the primary Series 4 model. There are new Nike watchfaces and sport bands, including three molded bands (all black, white with a black accent, and black with a neon yellow accent). There’s also a woven band in black or a silvery gray with reflective thread woven in. The Watch comes with the Nike Run Club app and Nike Training Club app preinstalled, which offers over 180 workouts. The Apple Watch Nike+ Series 4 comes in 40mm and 44mm sizes, and it can be bought as a package with any of the aforementioned bands, minus the black and neon yellow ones. (They have to be purchased separately.) This new Apple Watch Nike+ model is priced between $399 and $499 in the US, and additional bands can be bought for $49 each. The Watch is widely available starting today around the world, including in the US, Australia, Canada, UK, and large swaths of Asia and Europe. "
VERGE,Jarvish’s smart motorcycle helmets will offer Alexa and Siri support and an AR display,10/05/18,https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/5/17940960/jarvish-smart-motorcycle-helmets-alexa-siri-support-augmented-reality-kickstarter," Smart helmets seem like one of those great ideas that just haven’t really taken off yet, but that doesn’t mean that companies aren’t still trying. Jarvish — the latest to try to claim the crown — has an interesting take on the idea with its upcoming Jarvish X and Jarvish X-AR motorcycle helmets (via Engadget). The Jarvish X is the more basic of the two models. It offers integrated microphones and speakers for Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa support so wearers have access things like directions, weather updates, and control music through voice control. There’s also a 2K, front-facing camera built into the helmet so you can record your ride. It’s set to cost $799 when it hits Kickstarter in January.  The X-AR goes a step beyond that, offering all of those features and adding a Google Glass-style augmented reality display for things like current speed, turn-by-turn directions, weather, incoming calls, and even a rearview mirror-esque video feed from a second rear-facing camera on the back of the helmet. It’s an ambitious idea, but it’ll really depend on how well it works in practice. (AR displays are notoriously tough to get right.) The added AR tech also makes the Jarvish X-AR far more expensive at $2,599, and it won’t be out until much later; a Kickstarter is planned for the second half of 2019. Engadget notes that Jarvish is already selling the first generation of X helmets in Taiwan, so that may help allay some of your concerns about the tech when these helmets go on sale next year. "
VERGE,British spy agency casts more doubt on spy chip report,10/05/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/5/17941396/hack-apple-amazon-bloomberg-china-chip," The UK’s top national cybersecurity agency GCHQ told Reuters on Friday that it didn’t see any reason to question the validity of Apple and Amazon’s denials that their servers were compromised following a meteoric report from Bloomberg on Thursday. The report claimed that Chinese spies were able to place microchips in the companies’ servers, allegedly giving the Chinese government backdoor access to some of the largest cloud platforms in the world. The GCHQ, which is the UK’s equivalent to the US National Security Agency (NSA), didn’t call for an investigation into the claims, but it requested that anyone with information about the alleged attack reach out. In its response to Reuters, the GCHQ said, “We are aware of the media reports but at this stage have no reason to doubt the detailed assessments made by AWS and Apple,” said the National Cyber Security Centre, a unit of GCHQ. “The NCSC engages confidentially with security researchers and urges anybody with credible intelligence about these reports to contact us,” it said. Despite the unconcerned reaction from the British spy agency, American lawmakers are getting fired up over the reporting; some are even calling for an outright investigation. A spokesperson for Rep. Tom Cotton (R-AR) told Politico on Thursday that, “It’s past time for American companies to wake up and realize that [Chinese President] Xi Jinping and his cronies view private enterprise as ‘fair game’ in their subversive campaign against our nation.”  Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), who called Chinese hardware companies ZTE and Huawei “national security threats” this summer, told Politico that the report “provides more evidence that China’s pattern of behavior is a serious threat to national security and supply chain risk management.” Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ), the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, was the most assertive, calling the report “deeply disturbing,” and requesting a congressional investigation in a statement to Bloomberg. There are a whole bunch of plausible explanations that don't require fraud. There was no fraud involved in #badbios or it's journalistic coverage, and dozens of experts (correctly) confirmed to reporters it was technically plausible. Many in the cybersecurity world have also questioned the report. Tavis Ormandy, a star researcher at Google’s Project Zero, argued on Twitter that the reporting might be overblown, saying, “there are a whole bunch of plausible explanations that don’t require fraud.” "
VERGE,Nintendo could release a nostalgia-inducing playable Game Boy case,10/05/18,https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/5/17941084/nintendo-game-boy-iphone-smartphone-case-playable," In 2016, Nintendo started developing games designed specifically to be played on smartphones. Titles like Super Mario Run and Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp have brought some of the world’s most lovable characters to our pockets without the tactical buttons or plastic, boxy devices we knew and loved. That might be changing, though, because Nintendo has submitted an application for a patent that would make your smartphone look and feel just like a Game Boy. The patent application was filed this spring, and it describes a case that would fold over a smartphone, showcasing the classic rectangular Game Boy design. There’s a square cutout in the case which let the phone serve as the pseudo-handheld’s screen, and the buttons below it would be interactive, capable of delivering the input to the touchscreen. It’s something that other third-party companies have tried to do before — with varying degrees of success. Patents don’t always result in products, but Nintendo is having a pretty solid run on behalf of its nostalgia-fueled releases. The NES Classic sold out immediately following its release in 2016, and that excitement continued when it was re-released this summer, selling more systems than the PS4, Xbox One, and the Switch in the month of June. It wouldn’t be surprising for the company to meld its classic games and devices with a new case and bring them to mobile. And they should. I desperately want to play Kirby’s Dream Land on my phone without having to use emulators."
VERGE,This robotic finger attachment for your smartphone will gently caress your hand,10/05/18,https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2018/10/5/17940708/mobilimb-robotic-finger-attachment-smartphone," Our smartphones are cold, passive devices that usually can’t move autonomously unless they’re falling onto our faces while we’re looking at them in bed. A research team in France is exploring ways to change that by giving our smartphones the ability to interact with us more (via New Scientist). MobiLimb is a robotic finger attachment that plugs in through a smartphone’s Micro USB port, moves using five servo motors, and is powered by an Arduino microcontroller. It can tap the user’s hand in response to phone notifications, be used as a joystick controller, or, with the addition of a little fuzzy sheath accessory, it can turn into a cat tail. MobiLimb is a research project by PhD student Marc Teyssier and his team across from French universities. Teyssier shares more process photos on his website as well as a detailed explanation for the project. “In the spirit of human augmentation, which aims at overcoming human body limitations by using robotic devices, our approach aims at overcoming mobile device limitations (static, passive, motionless) by using a robotic limb,” he writes. There’s definitely an unsettling, creepy way in how it moves. Maybe it’s the way it drags its lifeless phone-body across the table to let you know you have a new message. Or maybe it’s the human flesh cover for the finger that turns it into a dismembered digit? I can’t quite place my MobiLimb on it. Then again, maybe a finger softly stroking your wrist isn’t all that different from those disembodied limbs we like to rest our heads on at the end of a long day to substitute for the loving touch of a boyfriend or girlfriend. Are... are we okay?  "
VERGE,Windows 10’s latest update is deleting some users’ documents,10/05/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/5/17940902/microsoft-windows-10-october-2018-update-deleting-documents-issues," Microsoft released its latest Windows 10 October 2018 Update earlier this week, but some users are reporting serious issues. Threads on Reddit, Microsoft’s own support site, and other forums show that some Windows 10 users are upgrading to the October 2018 Update and having their documents, photos, or even entire user profiles wiped out. While some have discovered a temporary fix for the issue, it’s not clear why exactly this is happening. Microsoft has not started automatically pushing this latest update out to Windows Update, so only people that visit Windows Update manually and check for updates will get it installed right now. Still, the fact a number of people are reporting these issues is alarming. Microsoft is currently investigating the reports, but given these early issues we’d recommend not installing the Windows 10 October 2018 Update right now. If you do want to take the risk, make sure you’ve got all your documents and data backed up just in case you’re affected by this particular bug. The Verge has reached out to Microsoft to comment on the issues, and we’ll update you accordingly."
VERGE,"What’s In Your Bag, R3hab?",10/05/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/5/17926438/whats-in-your-bag-r3hab," What’s in your bag? is a recurring feature where we ask people to tell us a bit more about their everyday gadgets by opening their bags and hearts to us. This week, we’re featuring music producer and DJ R3hab. R3hab, real name Fadil El Ghoul, strides into The Verge with a bubbling energy that ekes into every corner. “Who’s the sound man?” El Ghoul says to the room as he plunks down for his interview. “Make me sound really cool! It’s crazy what a little bit of compression does. Sometimes I listen to myself on the radio and my voice sounds deep!” Everyone cracks a smile. El Ghoul simply can’t help but talk about engineering audio wherever he goes. The 32-year-old Moroccan-born DJ and producer first popped onto people’s radars in the early aughts, as one of the leaders of the Dutch house music movement alongside names like Afrojack and Chuckie. While on the rise, he racked up millions of plays making four-on-the-floor festival fuel like “Prutataaa,” and was signed to Afrojack’s label. Over the years, the sound he’s put forth has changed, found nuance, and simmered down from raw sawtooth waves and thick kick drums. His 2017 debut album Trouble showed a wider breadth for El Ghoul, and he’s doubled down on exploring slower tempos with recently released follow-up album The Wave. Though there are a couple showings for big room tracks on The Wave, the album dances all over, from pop to future bass. But mostly pop. There’s even songs that don’t fit into any genre neatly, like “Cherry Blossom,” which uses sounds from a mechanical music box paired against a wandering, lazy and buzzy main line. According to El Ghoul, he had no option other than to dip into other genres. He stopped getting inspiration from making house songs at 128BPM again, and again, and again. “It’s maybe like a chef,” he tells The Verge when trying to describe his musical path. “If you cook Italian the whole time, you don’t get inspired anymore. I was getting less inspired, so I changed the tempo and now I’m even more inspired on the high energy music.” See what else gets El Ghoul going, literally, below. So you’re a Dutch national and you travel a lot. How many flights do you take a year? A couple of years ago I made a contest on my social media saying, “Guess how many flights?” and it was 228 in one year! I have not counted them again but I’m still the same status on all the airlines so I think it’s still around 200 a year. Where’s home? Home is where my laptop is. It’s where I make my music. I live out of a suitcase and a bag. But, I live in Belgium right now. What’s the one thing you couldn’t do without in your bag? Laptop! It’s actually a funny story. I was at a certain airport, and I was with my VJ and they confiscated his laptop for no reason. I think they wanted to confiscate mine, too. And I said it’s not happening. That’s my life. That’s my music. They took his laptop and we never got it back. Of course I have backups, but I need this every day. This is my stress reliever, my music maker, and my friend. It sounds weird, but that’s where I can express myself. Where do you spend your time when you’re not performing? In the studio. And I like to work out. When I’m not performing I’m still performing behind the laptop. Also I like to go out when I’m traveling and see the cities where I’m at. Now looking back I regret the times where I was not enjoying, I was not seeing the cities, seeing the culture, and I’m actively doing that now. It is difficult because you arrive and then you want to relax, but I’m like nope, Fadil, let’s go out for two hours. Let’s see the city. Let’s enjoy and feel the energy. Let’s talk about some of your music. Your song “Hold On Tight” from earlier this year sounds very London to me. Yeah, it’s got an ‘80s vibe. I love the ‘80s, synth-wise specifically. When I did my debut album, Trouble, it was actually pretty soft tempo on purpose. At a certain point I was making music for 10 years and I was stuck on that 128BPM counter every time. I was like, I need to get out of it, because the ideas run out. So my debut album and my new album are a lot more downtempo. It’s just more inspiring for me. It’s maybe like a chef. If you cook Italian the whole time, you don’t get inspired anymore. I was getting less inspired, so I changed the tempo and now I’m even more inspired on the high energy music. Tell us about the laptop. What’s on it? All my music. It’s a fully specced out laptop with the biggest hard drive. So I have to carry less in my bag because I hate carrying extra hard disks. I once lost one a couple of years ago and said never again. I use it every day for my music and my e-mails and everything. You’re on the road all the time with your laptop, your baby. How do you write music using that? I’m using Ableton on my MacBook with all software plug-ins. For me, what has happened is I get inspired after shows. I’m like, “Oh this could have been better. I need a record like this.” And that’s how I start writing. And many times I use my phone for voice memos. One of my records that just got released, it’s from a voice memo where I had the melody in my head. And then I started composing and finding the right sounds for it. But many times I have some chords or something, and then I have a lot of voice memos. And mostly those voice memos come after the show, when I’m fully inspired. I just played, and I felt the energy, and then I start composing. What phone are you carrying? I think this is an iPhone 7 Plus? I didn’t switch to the X yet. I like this one a lot, and it’s working really well, and I like the little stand so when I’m on a plane I can watch something. So yeah, I’m staying on this one. I’ve got to ask you about the headphones. Because we’ve had a lot of arguments in The Verge office about headphones. For traveling, comfort is most important. These have a latency so I have to put in the cable. I have other headphones I DJ with. I don’t think these sound amazing, but the noise cancellation just gives that rest on the plane. That constant buzzing is frustrating. I think they need to step it up, all of the noise-cancellation [headphones]. These break quick. How do you feel about dongle life? I have this thing, which can charge and you can put four USBs in. I’m not a big fan of the system but I believe USB-C will be the future in a couple of years. So it is what it is — you have to do it. But it’s frustrating because if I lose this thing, and I need USB-Bs to play my sets with then I’m messed up. I have smaller backups with me, but yeah, it’s annoying. And what are you carrying for charging up? A Mophie. I’ve got a MiFi for internet. Back in the day I would just hotspot from my phone but that just drains the battery. Anker is really nice because it also has USB-C, which I can use to charge as a backup. Then I have a strong cable for the iPhone. I don’t know why Apple can’t make normal cables themselves because they break all the time. Probably because they like that people buy new cables [laughs]. I noticed a little bit of tech there that we probably don’t see in the US a lot. It’s a little banking thing. Tell us about that. It’s called an identifier. You put your [credit card] inside and then you can log in and make payments. I think you can make payments on a phone [app] that are below a certain amount, but when you want to make bigger payments you have to use this as protection. You just bought a camera. What’s that all about? Yeah I have like a bigger camera and, of course, the phone camera. The phone is handy, but sometimes not creative because then you go on your social media and stuff. So I bought this camera, a new Sony. It has a nice selfie thing so that’s handy when I’m doing a show because I want to show my fans more behind-the-scenes footage. On Instagram there’s a nice picture and it’s that moment, but it doesn’t show how we got to that moment. And that’s what I want to show. I’m trying. I started recording. It’s not that great yet, but I just want to show people what it is like to be on a tour for six days, and what you carry with you, what you do, what you eat, and how your day looks like. Because they only see the part from 1AM to 3AM, but what’s the rest? I want to do a vlog. Not many electronic artists have one. And I decided to buy this [camera] because I can actually see myself and it’s nice and small. Are there any vloggers you watch? You know I haven’t watched too many vloggers. There’s only a couple I really follow like Casey Neistat. But personally I’m not a fan of most vloggers. Most of them I despise. I hope to give some quality to the people and life. I don’t want to show like, I’m so cool, look at me making this. Come on guys let’s give some substance, you know? How important do you think it is to still play live in front of an audience? It’s nice to have a social media presence. I think we have around 7 million on Facebook, 2.2 million on Instagram, and more than 1 million on Twitter. The thing is, there is a connection with the fans, but you cannot feel the energy like you feel live, because with live you feel the emotion. It’s nice when I play a festival — I absorb that emotion also. It makes me excited. Of course, posting is nice, but you only show the best on social media and a show is a journey. It’s a roller coaster ride of emotions. That is the biggest difference for me. Tell us about the money. When you’re traveling you always have your wallet with you and a lot of cards. But in some countries they don’t like certain credit cards and they like cash. I have a little bit of cash for tipping, of course, and also to pay cabs or whatever. Also when I was 30 I wanted a really nice watch [points to wrist]. Gold is always a good currency around the world. So this watch, if I ever get stuck and I lose everything I can still sell my watch and fly back home. It’s your get out of jail free card. Why do you have so many health supplements? It’s actually not that many because when I do supplements, I do research. I’m not a big fan of these packet supplements with 20 things. I like to do them all separately and organically. So for example, here’s fish oil and here’s cod liver oil, and they’re separate. I like to take them separately because fats you need with certain vitamins. It seems a lot but it’s actually not that much. I put them in daily packages, because I can put it in my pocket if I’m going to dinner and I don’t want to carry this [picks up big container]. It’s vitamin D, magnesium, turmeric, rhodiola, cod liver oil, fish oil, spirulina, and then potassium. How did you start on the keto diet? I started on the keto diet because I was having these troubles while traveling. I would eat a lot of snacks and I would get headaches on the plane. I read a couple of books and [watched] some clips on YouTube. I was like, it would be amazing if I wouldn’t eat sugar. I read about intermediate fasting, and then I found combination paleo keto. So, I have all these fat bombs. That’s how we call them. Sugar-free chocolate with a lot of fat, coconut oil, electrolytes, stevia, because when you’re on keto you need to keep your electrolytes in. Grass-fed [beef stick] with no carbs. And here an almond bar which is keto, paleo, and low glycemic-inspired. And some tea for on the plane because you need to drink a lot. Water tastes really bad on the plane and they always have a poor selection of teas. I don’t want to drink caffeine on the plane, so I bring my own little teas. What else have you got here? The only other thing that I really like that I travel with is a cream. It’s pretty weird. It’s sort of a clay and you put it on like... I don’t know what the English word for that is... but it removes the [armpit] odors for a couple of days which is absolutely crazy and you could still put deodorant on it. But it’s very handy. You know with traveling in airports it’s busy, it’s hectic, it’s sweaty. What about these socks? These are compression socks. They’re nice for flying. I actually just started using them, but they seem to help. Maybe it’s a placebo effect. I’m not sure. When did you first decide to become a DJ? I think I was 15 or 16. I was at a school party and I wanted to dance with girls in a slow song. Finally the slow song came on and I was dancing, and then the DJ changed it to a different song and I’m like, why are you changing it! I’m just dancing! And then I realized, wow this guy is really powerful. He’s the director of the night. And that’s what made me realize I love music. That’s crazy that you can be the director of the night and that you can change people’s emotions. Did you ever have a plan B career? My mother made sure there was a plan B. I have a degree in business marketing. When I finished my degree, I asked my mother if I could stay with her for a year because I didn’t have any money. I said [let me] pursue making music again and see if I could get any success in a year. And yeah, that happened in a year. So, now we’re here. Where do you want to go from here? Where do I want to go in my career? You know, it’s going very well. I’m looking toward the next five years. I want to inspire people, not only musically, but also mentally, because my biggest trouble in the whole music business was mentally how difficult it is. It’s very draining and I feel like a lot of kids need that knowledge. Everyone thinks, oh it’s just about the music, it’s about the records, but it’s also the mental state. How do you feel after playing for these people? It’s a big rush, right? It’s a big adrenalin pump and then you’re in your hotel room all alone. How can you manage these emotions? That’s what I struggled with. And I have now sort of managed to live with those. Vox Media has affiliate partnerships.

VERGE,"After the SEC settlement, who will review Elon Musk’s tweets?",10/05/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/5/17937768/elon-musk-sec-settlement-twitter-tesla-shareholder-lawsuit," Plenty of important and knowledgeable people have already weighed in on Elon Musk’s settlement with the SEC: what it means for the shareholder lawsuits, what it means for the DOJ investigation, whether it’s a good settlement. I would like to talk about Twitter dot com. I live for this. Just want to that the Shortseller Enrichment Commission is doing incredible work. And the name change is so on point! Musk’s Twitter use figures heavily in the SEC complaint, and I have repeatedly suggested that Musk is an object lesson for the rest of us about social media: never tweet. (I will never learn this lesson, and probably neither will Musk.) Anyway, from the original complaint: On Tuesday, August 7, 2018, Musk published a series of statements about a transaction to take Tesla private using his personal Twitter account.  Musk did not consult with Tesla’s Board of Directors, any other Tesla employees, or any outside advisors about these tweets before publishing them.   This Week in Elon This Week in Elon is a segment on The Vergecast hosted by Deputy Editor Elizabeth Lopatto and now available as a limited-run newsletter. If you want all of the dizzying news about Elon Musk and companies delivered to your inbox on Fridays, subscribe here. This is honestly not much of a surprise, but it is profoundly unusual. Most CEOs have a huge and mostly invisible apparatus around them to prevent anything horrible from happening. They engage in carefully controlled speech, and even minor appearances are often vetted by legal or public relations, often both, says Evelyn Cruz Sroufe, a partner at Perkins Coie who handles corporate law. Anything a CEO wants to say that’s either likely to generate news or be material to the company is typically aired with the board or a representative of the board; investor relations is typically also involved, she says. This is assuming the CEOs write the tweets themselves; mostly, they don’t, says David Moyer, the president of executive search firm Moyer, Sherwood Associates. (The firm specializes in communications and investor relations.) For example, if I’m CEO of Ride the Lightning, a company that makes mountain bikes for dirtbags, I am likely not tweeting from my own “personal” account. Instead, someone in the communication department drafts the tweet, someone in legal looks it over, and then I, as CEO, approve it. I don’t write it myself! I am a busy and important dirtbag CEO!  Tweeting CEOs are less unusual in Silicon Valley culture and in the tech space, generally. Most CEOs don’t tweet that much, and the ones who tweet themselves do generally have a working knowledge of SEC regulations — at least, they know enough to avoid saying anything material in a tweet. But Musk’s Twitter use “is pretty unusual because of the volume of stuff he puts out,” Sroufe says, “and the ungoverned nature of what comes out.” Moyer puts it more bluntly: “He’s all id.” The SEC isn’t the only action Musk has faced as a result of his unfiltered Twitter use. Leaving aside the Justice Department probe into that exact same tweet, there’s also the defamation suit filed by Vernon Unsworth, the cave explorer Musk referred to as a “pedo,” and a complaint from the National Labor Relations Board about anti-union tweets. These are some expensive tweets! Even if Musk wins everything coming at him, he still has to pay $20 million to the SEC plus whatever his lawyers cost. And while lawyers — I love you, you sophists! — are full of entertaining zingers, those zingers are expensive.  So, Musk might welcome some Twitter intervention! In any event, the SEC is demanding that Tesla “put in place additional controls and procedures to oversee Musk’s communications.” Ahhhh. The person screaming “LOG OFF” at Musk’s house is the SEC. (Of course, the settlement might change, as a judge is inquiring about it. Stay tuned for next week, when the SEC and Musk have to put a letter together to justify it!) But the SEC requirement that someone oversee his tweets doesn’t work if Musk doesn’t go along with it. And it’s not clear how Tesla plans to manage this. Spokesman Dave Arnold told me that the company doesn’t “have anything further to share at this point.” I hope you enjoy speculation, because I am about to speculate about how this could go. While Musk could hire a factotum to handle his Twitter account — one whose entire job is to tweet normal (?) stuff like Naughty By Nature videos, but vet any Tesla stuff with the board — and never look at Twitter again, that seems unlikely. In the absence of physically inserting a human between Musk’s thumbs and the mobile Twitter app, Tesla will have to rely on Musk’s judgment when it comes to vetting his spicier tweets.  Who would review Musk’s Tesla hot takes? It could be an independent board member or more than one. A committee of independent board members would be a natural choice where Musk could check his tweets, Sroufe tells me. That’s the most flexible way to handle it: to have some independent person with good judgment vetting the tweets before they go live. “Whether he’s willing to do that is a real open question,” Sroufe says. If he isn’t, it’s not clear what happens next because it’s not clear what kind of formal process the board can impose. “The ideal way is that they take over his Twitter account and review everything, but I just don’t think you’re going to get there with him,” Sroufe says. One person, an architect of a CEO-public-persona-apparatus for a large tech company you have certainly have heard of, expressed skepticism that Musk would be able to stick to the terms of the SEC deal — at least when it comes to his Twitter use. Musk won’t listen, the person said. Moyer agrees: sooner or later, Musk is going to screw up, he says. So… what happens then? That part isn’t clear either, even though Musk’s Twitter kerfuffles this year have, so far, cost Tesla shareholders $20 million (plus lawyers’ fees). That may mean the actual enforcement mechanism will end up being shareholder lawsuits. Musk’s tweets are a liability issue as well as a board oversight issue, Sroufe says. If the board cannot set up a process to control the fuego tweets, shareholders are unlikely to be shy about suing. And because Musk has been specifically admonished by the SEC regarding the nature of his Twitter habit, it may be easier for those shareholders to make their cases. The last thing any Twitter user wants is to be accosted by one’s followers. Look, it’s probably better for Tesla if Musk tweets less — honestly the best-case scenario is for him to delete his account — but it’s worse for me, personally. I like Musk’s tweets! I even like the bad ones! I don’t necessarily love that I have to drop whatever I’m doing (usually editing stuff that’s way less time-sensitive) to report or edit reports on Musk’s tweets, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t relate. The only people who don’t do dumb shit on Twitter aren’t on Twitter. Anyway, Musk’s Twitter presence has been educational for me — even just this week! I’ve wondered for years who could possibly use the Apple Stocks app, which I have never once opened. It turns out, the answer is Elon Musk.  Something especially weird going on with Yahoo news feed on iPhone stocks app. Almost always super negative. Maybe getting gamed. With reporting by Nilay Patel. This Week in Elon"
VERGE,"Facebook’s head of public policy is supporting the Kavanaugh nomination, and some employees are livid",10/05/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/5/17939054/facebook-employee-protest-joel-kaplan-brett-kavanaugh," On September 27th, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh appeared before Congress to answer allegations that he had committed sexual assault. There to support him was one of his best friends, Joel Kaplan, who also happens to be Facebook’s global head of policy. I made passing note of Kaplan’s attendance here when it happened, and asked readers — particularly those in Facebook’s orbit — what they made of it. Well, now we know. Here’s Mike Isaac in the New York Times: Mr. Kaplan’s surprise appearance prompted anger and shock among many Facebook employees, some of whom said they took his action as a tacit show of support for Judge Kavanaugh — as if it were an endorsement from Facebook itself. The unrest quickly spilled over onto Facebook’s internal message boards, where hundreds of workers have since posted about their concerns, according to current and former employees. To quell the hubbub, Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, last Friday explained in a widely attended staff meeting that Mr. Kaplan was a close friend of Judge Kavanaugh’s and had broken no company rules, these people said. A similar set of documents appears to have been leaked to the Wall Street Journal’s Deepa Seetharaman, who reaches similar conclusions in her own story. For Facebook, the controversy over Kaplan represents a new point of division at a company that is still grappling with the Instagram founders’ unexpected departure and the largest data breach in its history. Only when it comes to the Kaplan controversy, it’s not clear to me what the company’s next move should be. The C suite seems to have been annoyed by Kaplan’s attendance, but was initially dismissive of employees’ concerns. (How concerned are employees? My favorite detail in Isaac’s story is that they went into Kaplan’s calendar and learned that he had not in fact taken the 27th as a personal day, as Kaplan initially stated. The calendar was later updated to reflect that it was, indeed, a personal day.) In ordinary times, it would not even seem worthy of commentary that a Facebook employee would take time off to go support a good friend’s nomination for a government role. But these are no ordinary times, and this was no ordinary hearing. And among some Facebook employees, who have rallied around Kavanaugh’s proliferating number of accusers, Kaplan’s endorsement of his friend became a workplace issue. As Isaac notes, Kaplan was hired precisely because of his deep ties to the conservative world. Facebook faces a variety of federal investigations and regulatory threats, and it needs allies in both parties to navigate those waters — particularly these days. Until now, Kaplan’s conservatism has been seen an asset to the company. It still is — somewhere on Facebook’s communications team right now, I imagine there’s some mild excitement about a news cycle centered on its executives standing up to their more liberal employees in the defense of a conservative colleague. But it can be a liability, too, particularly if a lot of those employees take this opportunity to leave the company to work at an organization that doesn’t have a strategic imperative to make nice with the Trump Administration. Andrew Bosworth, a 13-year Facebook veteran and Zuckerberg confidante, initially appeared to encourage employees to follow their principles out the door. Here’s Isaac again: “If you need to change teams, companies or careers to make sure your day-to-day life matches your passions, we will be sad to see you go, but we will understand,” Mr. Bosworth wrote. “We will support you with any path you choose. But it is your responsibility to choose a path, not that of the company you work for.” But after an employee backlash, Boz walked back his remarks. “I spoke at a time when I should be listening and that was a big mistake,“ he reportedly wrote in an internal post. Another meeting is scheduled for Friday for top executives to listen to employees’ concerns. The trouble for Facebook is that it’s not clear, beyond listening, what Facebook can really do. The Big Hack: How China Used a Tiny Chip to Infiltrate U.S. Companies Everyone is talking about this story from Jordan Robertson and Michael Riley, which alleges that Chinese spies compromised America’s technology supply chain by inserting tiny chips in servers that reached almost 30 US companies, including Apple and Amazon. Both Apple and Amazon denied this story in the strongest possible terms, going into depth about how why they believe the Bloomberg story to be false. It’s an extraordinary set of events — I hope we learn more. (Facebook appears to have been affected by the hack in a minor way.) Pence Calls on Google to Drop Mobile Search Project in China The vice president has called on Google to abandon its China ambitions — a significant escalation of the US government’s pressure on Alphabet, Michael C. Bender and Dustin Volz report: In a speech that outlined the White House’s long list of frustrations and grievances with Beijing, Vice President Mike Pence called on companies to reconsider business practices in the world’s second-largest economy that involve turning over intellectual property or “abetting Beijing’s oppression.” “For example, Google should immediately end development of the Dragonfly app that will strengthen Communist Party censorship and compromise the privacy of Chinese customers,” Mr. Pence said in his speech at the Hudson Institute, a conservative, Washington-based think tank focused on security and economic issues. Most Twitter Accounts Linked To 2016 Disinformation Are Still Active, Report Find Nearly 90 percent of accounts that spread disinformation during the presidential election continue to operate and spread or amplify false stories, according to a new study from the Knight Foundation: Knight Foundation researchers examined millions of tweets and concluded that more than 80 percent of the accounts associated with the 2016 disinformation campaign are still posting — even after Twitter announced back in July that it had instituted a purge of fake accounts. “The persistence of so many easily identified abusive accounts is difficult to square with any effective crackdown,” write authors Matthew Hindman of George Washington University and Vlad Barash of the social media analysis company Graphika. I asked Twitter to respond and this is what I got: “Firstly, this study was built using our public API and therefore does not take into account any of the actions we take to remove automated or spammy content and accounts from being viewed by people on Twitter. We do this proactively and at scale, every single day. Secondly, as a uniquely open service, Twitter is a vital source of real-time antidote to day-to-day falsehoods. We are proud of this use case and work diligently to ensure we are showing people context and a diverse range of perspectives as they engage in civic debate and conversations on our service.” Senators Call for Federal Investigation of Children’s Apps Two Democrats have asked the Federal Trade Commission to examine whether thousands of apps are violating a children’s online privacy law. Jennifer Valentino-DeVries and Natasha Singer report: Senators Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday saying they were concerned that thousands of apps may “improperly track children and collect their personal information.” The senators asked the agency to examine whether the apps, and the advertising companies they work with, were violating a federal law to protect children’s privacy online. The law requires sites and apps aimed at children under 13 to obtain verifiable permission from a parent before collecting personal details from a child like an email address, a precise location, a phone number or persistent digital ID codes that are used for behavioral advertising. How China’s biggest social network fights fake news WeChat posts the top rumors every month… so it can debunk them. This would be a more heartening development if WeChat were not also a surveillance and propaganda tool of the Chinese government! Europe is drawing fresh battle lines around the ethics of big data The European Union’s data protection supervisor, Giovanni Buttarelli, tells TechCrunch that tech giants are flouting new privacy regulations and he’s not going to take it anymore: “I did not appreciate the tsunami of legalistic notices landing on the account of millions of users, written in an obscure language, and many of them were entirely useless, and in a borderline even with spamming, to ask for unnecessary agreements with a new privacy policy,” he tells us. “Which, in a few cases, appear to be in full breach of the GDPR — not only in terms of spirit.” He also professes himself “not surprised” about Facebook’s  latest security debacle — describing the massive new data breach the company revealed on Friday as “business as usual” for the tech giant. And indeed for “all the tech giants” — none of whom he believes are making adequate investments in security. Snap CEO Sets Goal of Profitability in 2019, Outlines New Strategic Goals for Employees Evan Spiegel wants Snap to turn a profit in 2019, according to a 6,500-word memo that Alex Heath got his hands on. (Big day for my rivals getting their hands on documents to make me jealous! I have a Signal too, folks!) I’m going to chew on this one overnight, but for now here’s a fun, Snap-flattering detail from Spiegel: Researchers at the University of Michigan found that Snapchat was second only to face-to-face communication when it comes to generating positive feelings: Snapchat interactions are associated with more positive emotions that Facebook and other social technologies, the researchers say. Social media analytics platform Hootsuite explores sale: sources Hootsuite, which makes a widely used platform for managing social media, is exploring a sale that could value it at more than $750 million, Liana B. Baker and Carl O’Donnell report. Unilad: Facebook viral publisher goes into administration One of the biggest publishers of viral content on Facebook is apparently close to being bankrupt: Its understanding of the sort of video content Facebook audiences want to watch enabled it to become the fourth-biggest publisher on the social network in August, according to data from the analytics company NewsWhip. Facebook recently said it would prioritise higher-quality news in users’ feeds. Many viral publishers have struggled to translate their enormous reach into a profitable business model, owing to the high cost of making bespoke native ads. Sources in the advertising industry suggested many agencies had cut back their dealings with Unilad before Thursday. Instagram COO Marne Levine: App Is Safe After Founders’ Facebook Exit Former Instagram COO and new Facebook head of Global Partnerships and Business Development Marne Levine spoke briefly about her old bosses’ exit from the company last week during a conference this week. She acknowledged that it was “unexpected”: She added that, while the moment was unexpected, it was “only natural” that the founders, “whose vision… had fundamentally changed the way we connect and share,” would be thinking about what’s next after spending six years steering Instagram at Facebook. She pointed out that when the social media giant acquired Instagram, the photo-sharing platform had just 13 employees and “no business.” Today, it has more than a billion users and “a thriving and growing business” with more than two million active advertisers and more than 1,000 employees worldwide. “It’s is in a very different place,” she said. When Tech Knows You Better Than You Know Yourself Historian Yuval Noah Harari and Time Well Spent cofounder Tristan Harris discussed the future of artificial intelligence with Wired’s editor in chief, Nicholas Thompson. There’s surely lots to chew on here, but this is just an incredible story about how thought leaders are meeting these days: YNH: Funnily enough, on an expedition to Antarctica, we were invited by the Chilean government to the Congress of the Future to talk about the future of humankind and one part of the Congress was an expedition to the Chilean base in Antarctica to see global warming with our own eyes. It was still very cold and there were so many interesting people on this expedition TH: A lot of philosophers and Nobel laureates. And I think we particularly connected with Michael Sandel, who is a really amazing philosopher of moral philosophy. The Teens Who Post the Same Thing Every Day on Instagram Earlier this week Alyssa Bereznak tweeted a comical set of Instagram accounts that post the same picture every day. It turns out Taylor Lorenz was already at work on a version of this story, which she published today. It’s delightful: And while these accounts post the same photo every day, their captions and Stories change. Some teenagers who run single-pic accounts use their page as a sort of diary or anonymous blog, posting about what’s happening in life and at school, or how they’re feeling. “I had to pack the whole day and today I was on an airplane for like 8 hours,” the owner of an account that posts the same photo of a watermelon every day wrote. “Ya girl graduated grade 8,” the owner of @same_picture_of_kun said. “Catch me being late to my first day of summer school,” they added on another pic. Miranda, a 14-year-old who runs @same.picture.of.kumquat with two friends from her high school, said they started the account as a de-stressor and outlet. “It’s personal-life captions for not such a personal picture,” she said. “It takes the pressure off of having to post a pic of your face or something. We don’t have to edit any pics; the followers know what they’re getting. We can just post a quirky caption about our life at the moment and they relate.” Instagram’s Nametag make it easier to follow people you meet IRL WWW.THEVERGE.COM – Share Instagram is introducing a version of Snapcodes, letting you follow people by taking a picture of their unique “nametag.” More interesting to me is the test described here in which college students will be invited to fill out a more complete Instagram profile, including their school, which will then be added to a directory that anyone else in that school can browse. Facebook is Benjamin Buttoning itself all the way back to the beginning. Instagram, as a ""Facebook Product"", is testing Facebook Location History in their app.It allows tracking the history of precise locations from your device, now through instagram app toopreviously: https://t.co/JCQGnawJbV pic.twitter.com/S02lyIfTlu Instagram is also adding location history, in what seems part of an eventual effort to build a Snap Map-style feature into Instagram. (Josh Constine speculates that it’s’ about serving local ads.) Yahoo returns to messaging with IRC-inspired Yahoo Together Also Yahoo made a new messaging app for some reason? I got nothing. Finance, the media and a catastrophic breakdown in trust ($) John Authers has a long, reflective post about how social media contributed to an erosion of trust in journalism, and how dangerous that will prove to be during the next financial crisis. Sad and sobering: All the most obvious policy responses come with dangers. Regulating social media from its current sick and ugly state would have advantages but would also be the thin end of a very long wedge. Greater transparency and political oversight for central banks might rebuild confidence but at the risk of politicising institutions we desperately need to maintain independence from politicians. And an overhaul of the prosecutorial system for white-collar crime, to avert the scandalous way so many miscreants escaped a reckoning a decade ago, might work wonders for bolstering public trust — but not if it led to scapegoating or show trials. On one thing, I remain gloomily clear. Without trust in financial institutions themselves, or those who work in them, or the media who cover them, the next crisis could be far more deadly than the last. Just ask JP Morgan.  New FiDi Pasta Shop Literally Names Itself After Instagram Last June I wrote a long feature about how the popularity of Instagram was transforming bars and restaurants into more colorful, kitschy, gimmicky versions of themselves. Today that trend has now reached its logical conclusion, with a New York City pasta restaurant naming itself Pastagram and making its entire value proposition that you can take photographs of its food: But food isn’t entirely the point here. The Pastagram is really playing up the social media angle, promising “photogenic” details in all of its dishes as well as bright, teal decor in the space. “Every single detail is thought of as to be the most photogenic as possible, catering to a customer base that— today more than ever — seems to give aesthetics as much importance as food quality,” its press release declares I don’t know; there’s something about valuing the ‘gram above all at a restaurant that feels a bit … tasteless.

VERGE,Amazon’s Alexa companion app is getting a much-needed redesign,10/05/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/5/17940260/amazon-alexa-app-redesign-october-2018-devices-tab," The Alexa app, which acts as a piece of setup and companion software for Amazon’s Echo devices, just got a major visual redesign. The new app has a much improved user interface with easier control over Alexa-enabled smart home devices.  The biggest improvements can be seen in the devices tab, which now allows you to control individual smart lights and power outlets from a single screen at the same time as seeing them grouped by room. Elsewhere the update has focused more on the look of the app rather than adding any new functionality.  The update, which is in the process of rolling out for both iOS and Android worldwide, comes as Alexa is cementing itself as a smart home ecosystem to tie together all of your different devices. Amazon recently released a new hardware kit to make it easier for manufacturers to integrate Alexa support into their devices (such as a microwave) and updated its smart speaker lineup with a new Echo Plus that can control your smart home even when disconnected from the internet."
VERGE,Samsung returns to record profits,10/04/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/4/17939514/samsung-earnings-guidance-q3-2018," Samsung Electronics has smashed its record for the highest profit in a single quarter, according to guidance issued by the company today. Samsung expects to have made 17.5 trillion won ($15.5 billion) in operating profit off 65 trillion won ($57.5 billion) in revenue in the third quarter of 2018, a 20 percent increase year on year and nearly 12 percent higher than the company’s previous record of 15.64 million won from the first quarter of this year. Samsung doesn’t give a detailed breakdown of its various businesses’ performance until the full earnings release, so we’ll have to wait to see what has propelled the company to these new heights. With the Galaxy S9 disappointing in sales, though, components such as displays and memory are likely to be the main drivers. The third quarter is often important for new device launches; Apple releasing two new iPhone models with high-end Samsung-supplied OLED screens can’t have hurt the bottom line, for example."
VERGE,Apple is using proprietary software to lock MacBook Pros and iMac Pros from third-party repairs,10/04/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/4/17938820/apple-macbook-pro-imac-pro-third-party-repair-lock-out-software," Apple is reportedly using new proprietary software diagnostic tools to repair MacBook Pros and iMac Pros that, if not used on key part repairs, will result in an “inoperative system and an incomplete repair,” reads a document distributed to Apple’s Authorized Service Providers last month. A copy of the document was obtained by MacRumors and Motherboard today, both of which reported on the contents of the document and the apparent implications on third-party repair services.  It would seem that, without the proprietary software, third-party repair services will not be able to fix MacBook Pros that suffer from issues with the display assembly, the logic board, the keyboard and trackpad, and the Touch ID board, according to Motherboard. For iMac Pros, the lock will engage if you replace the logic board or flash storage. The computer won’t be usable again until Apple Service Toolkit 2, the name of the diagnostic tool, is used by a member of the company’s Authorized Service Provider program.  The measures are presumably there to ensure security. Apple’s proprietary chips have taken on increasing responsibilities over various functions inside the Mac, including storing secure enclave data and handling disc encryption. Especially on a day where hardware security is very much in the news, it seems reasonable to expect that Macs need to go through an Apple-approved diagnostic. But it’s also not traditionally how we like to think of PCs, which have historically not been sealed appliances. The Mac is apparently moving a little more in that direction. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Tech critics and e-waste activists, however, claim that electronics makers are making devices hard to repair as a way to tightly control the repair market and encourage the purchase of new devices. Apple, alongside other hardware makers, has fought in recent years to prevent the passing of so-called right-to-repair laws that would force technology companies to make parts and instructions available to both users and third-party repair specialists. As it stands today, 19 states have proposed legislation regarding right-to-repair rules, but no state has passed a bill that would ban the use of, say, proprietary diagnostic tools."
VERGE,"Chinese spy chips would be a ‘god-mode’ hack, experts say",10/04/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/4/17937210/bloomberg-china-microchip-hack-supermicro-amazon-apple-servers," Chinese operatives allegedly poisoned the technical supply chain of major US companies, including Apple and Amazon by planting a microchip on their servers manufactured abroad, according to a Bloomberg report today. The story claims that one chip, which was reportedly planted on servers’ motherboards assembled for a company called Elemental by a separate company called Super Micro Computer, would allow attackers to covertly modify these servers, bypass software security checks, and, essentially, give the Chinese government a complete backdoor into these companies’ networks. Affected companies are vigorously disputing the report, claiming they never discovered any malicious hardware or reported similar issues to the FBI. Even taking the Bloomberg report at its word, there are significant unanswered questions about how widely the chip was distributed and how the backdoor access was used. But the mere idea of a malicious chip implant has already sent shock waves through the security world, which has traditionally focused on software attacks. Nicholas Weaver, a professor at Berkeley’s International Computer Science Institute described an alarming attack. “My initial reaction was ‘HOLY FUCKING SHIT’ [sic],” Weaver told The Verge. “This is a ‘god mode’ exploit in the system management subsystem.” Security experts have warned for years that the hardware supply chain is at risk, especially considering that China has a monopoly on parts and manufacturing. Up until now, though, we haven’t seen a widespread attack on US companies, as Bloomberg claims to have found. There’s no real way to prevent a hardware attack like this, sources tell The Verge, unless the tech industry wants to drastically rethink how it gets its components and brings products to market. Katie Moussouris, founder and CEO of Luta Security, says an attacker could use this kind of malicious implant to bypass all software protections, a doomsday scenario for defenders. “If you manage to put something in place in hardware, not only is it difficult to detect, it’s also something that can bypass even the most sophisticated software security measures,” Moussouris told The Verge.  The result requires an entirely new kind of defense, replacing code audits and bug-hunting with checks for physical interference at the hardware level. Jake Williams, the founder of Rendition Infosec, says it would be an entirely new approach for security teams. “We have a bigger fundamental problem,” Williams says, “which is that this stuff is wicked hard to detect and we don’t have tools to do that.” In some ways, the attacks borrow techniques from jailbreaking, breaking the chain of trust between the hardware and the software instead of attacking the software itself. George Hotz, the legendary jailbreaker-turned-self-driving-entrepreneur, was skeptical of the Bloomberg story, but said a successful supply-chain attack would still be nearly impossible to mitigate with conventional security tools. “If you cannot trust your hardware, you cannot trust anything that the hardware checks,” Hotz says. “Fundamentally, there is no way to check for this in software.” It’s hard to say how companies like Apple and Amazon could adapt to these new risks. On the hardware level, strange behavior would be like trying to detect a heart murmur. There might be small anomalies every so often, but none would immediately cause alarm. And researchers looking for bugs might not be much help, either. Even if they could get these parts from Supermicro, for example, they’d need enough money and enough supply to run tests. Once you crash or damage a piece of hardware, it’s impossible to start over again, which make conventional bug bounties hard to implement. Instead, Moussouris says supply chain risks are a reality we have to accept. Companies have already made their compromise; in exchange for cheap parts, they take the supply chain risk.  “We’ve made choices to outsource the manufacturer of a lot of components in order to be able to get them to market and have them be a viable product,” she says. “Making sure that we understand that we’ve made these tradeoffs is the part that might be taking people by surprise.” Update 10/5, 7:57AM ET: Updated to clarify language in the first paragraph. Our second sentence initially said the chip was assembled abroad when it should have said the motherboard was."
VERGE,‘Smart TV kit’ bundling Google Home Mini and third-gen Chromecast leaks on Reddit,10/04/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/4/17938502/smart-tv-kit-google-home-mini-third-generation-chromecast," Yet another Google product has leaked before the company’s October 9th Pixel event, and this time, it’s a Smart TV kit that bundles a Google Home Mini and the new, unannounced third-generation Chromecast. In a Reddit post that has since been deleted, a retail employee posted a photo of the upcoming Smart TV kit with the caption, “Just got these bad boys in at work today.” It’s unknown where the Reddit user works, but we can guess that the product is from Walmart, based on the fact that the previous Smart TV kits were selling as a Walmart-exclusive for $74. This is further confirmation of a third-generation Chromecast, as just days earlier, Best Buy  accidentally stocked the unannounced product and solid it to a customer. We don’t know how much the new Chromecast will cost, or whether the new Smart TV kit will be more expensive than before, but there are only a few more days before we’ll find out officially during Google’s event."
VERGE,White House calls on Google to abandon controversial Chinese search engine project,10/04/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/4/17938376/google-china-search-engine-white-house-vp-mike-pence-criticism," Google’s censored search engine and news app for China has seen a considerable amount of controversy since news of the project first broke, but it may have just gotten its biggest pushback yet in the form of direct opposition from the Trump administration. According to The Wall Street Journal, Vice President Mike Pence commented today in a speech that Google’s modified search engine — currently under the codename Dragonfly — would “strengthen Communist Party censorship and compromise the privacy of Chinese customers.” The Intercept was the first to break the news about the censored search app earlier this year, with later reports revealing that Dragonfly reportedly links searches to phone numbers, making it easy for searches to be tracked and tied to specific individuals. Google has yet to formally confirm that Dragonfly even exists, with CEO Sundai Pichai reportedly commenting that things were simply “exploratory” and in the “early stages,” but that hasn’t stopped opposition to the program. The New York Times reports that around 1,400 Google employees have signed a letter demanding more transparency about Dragonfly, a group of House representatives have formally asked Google about the project, and The Intercept reported that Google senior research scientist Jack Poulson resigned in protest.  Google had previously operated its services in China until 2010, when the company pulled out after clashing with Beijing over an uncensored version of its search engine that Google ran out of Hong Kong (after Google discovered that China engaged in phishing attacks to target the information of Chinese human rights activists.) But China is also a hugely valuable market that’s home to nearly 1 billion internet users, so it’s easy to see why Google would want to go back. "
VERGE,Square is now letting customers pay in monthly installments,10/04/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/4/17937906/square-installments-monthly-payment-seller-customer," Square is introducing a new payment option for small businesses to let customers pay for large purchases in monthly installments. Called Square Installments, payment plans can be used for purchases ranging from $250 to $10,000, and customers can choose to pay over three, six, and 12 months. Annual percentage rates will vary from 0 to 24 percent APR. The feature is available now in 22 US states for businesses using Square, and customers have to be preapproved before they can start financing. Most customers will be able to see if they’re approved instantly, but there will be cases in which approval can take one to two business days. Once approved, customers will receive a one-time use digital card number they can show to merchants to pay for their purchases. There are no service fees involved, and customers will be able to see the total cost of their payment plans up front for each monthly payment available. All loans are issued by Square Capital, which also offers business loans to merchants. Square Capital will automatically deduct your monthly payments from your debit card, and it’s also what will show up on your credit report when you become approved for Square Installments. Square is moving into the consumer lending space as monthly installment options are becoming more popular. Companies like AfterPay and PayPal’s Credit let customers buy now and pay later, but the payment options have usually been limited for purchases from large retailers. Square Installments is now aiming to fill that space by offering the same payment options to small businesses. That puts Square in direct competition with PayPal co-founder Max Levchin’s startup Affirm, which last year launched a mobile app that generates one-time card numbers for online purchases that customers can then pay back in installments.

VERGE,These new Nokia headphones are waterproof wireless earbuds with built-in vibration,10/04/18,https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/4/17938002/nokia-7-1-wireless-headphones-earbuds," HMD Global, the company that releases Nokia smartphones, announced its new flagship product today, the Nokia 7.1, and along with it, two new accessories: True Wireless earbuds and the Nokia Pro Wireless Earphones. The Nokia True Wireless Earbuds provide up to 3.5 hours of use time, are waterproof, and come with a case that can charge the earbuds up to three times (for a total of 16 hours of play time). The Pro Wireless earbuds are connected to a neckband, have up to 10 hours of use, and have a built-in vibration to alert people when a call is coming in. Both accessories can be used to take calls without your phone. Nokia is the latest brand to hop on wireless headphones, following in the steps of other companies like Apple, Google, and Samsung. Even Huawei announced its own true wireless FreeBuds earlier this year — that look a lot like Apple’s AirPods. According to Android Authority, the True Wireless earbuds will retail for 129 euros ($148), and the Nokia Pro Wireless Earphones for 69 euros ($79)."
VERGE,Apple and Amazon explicitly deny claims that servers were compromised by Chinese chips,10/04/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/4/17936968/apple-amazon-deny-servers-chinese-spy-chips," Both Apple and Amazon are vehemently denying claims that their servers were compromised by Chinese spies following an explosive report from Bloomberg on Thursday. The report claims that spies were able to infiltrate some of the country’s biggest tech companies by inserting microchips the size of “a grain of rice” into Chinese-manufactured servers, part of the tech giants’ infrastructure. The report alleges that the companies discovered the chips on their own and notified US authorities, but both Apple and Amazon are refuting that any of the claims cited in the story are actually founded in reality. The responses are heavily detailed, denying the Bloomberg report point-by-point. It’s something these companies rarely, if ever, do. Most statements following the discovery of security flaws or public backlash only ever acknowledge the concerns and make vague promises on behalf of consumer privacy. After the Celebgate iCloud breach, for example, which included leaks of prominent celebrities’ nude photos, Apple’s response was one of minor outrage and a simple refutation of any security flaws. Amazon was met with a separate, but similarly detrimental exploit in 2014 when researchers discovered that by way of the Heartbleed bug, websites hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) had the potential to leak sensitive information like credit card numbers. Amazon’s response to the Heartbleed was simply, “AWS is aware of the HeartBleed Bug (CVE-2014-0160) in OpenSSL and investigating any impact or required remediation. We will post back when we have more detail.” But in this case, Apple and Amazon are denying it all. According to the companies, this infiltration never happened, and they’ve been telling Bloomberg that for a very long time. Some highlights from the responses released by Amazon, Apple, and the Chinese server manufacturer, Supermicro are listed below: It’s untrue that AWS knew about a supply chain compromise, an issue with malicious chips, or hardware modifications when acquiring Elemental. It’s also untrue that AWS knew about servers containing malicious chips or modifications in data centers based in China, or that AWS worked with the FBI to investigate or provide data about malicious hardware. We’ve re-reviewed our records relating to the Elemental acquisition for any issues related to SuperMicro, including re-examining a third-party security audit that we conducted in 2015 as part of our due diligence prior to the acquisition. We’ve found no evidence to support claims of malicious chips or hardware modifications. Over the course of the past year, Bloomberg has contacted us multiple times with claims, sometimes vague and sometimes elaborate, of an alleged security incident at Apple. Each time, we have conducted rigorous internal investigations based on their inquiries and each time we have found absolutely no evidence to support any of them. We have repeatedly and consistently offered factual responses, on the record, refuting virtually every aspect of Bloomberg’s story relating to Apple. . . . On this we can be very clear: Apple has never found malicious chips, “hardware manipulations” or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any server. Apple never had any contact with the FBI or any other agency about such an incident. We are not aware of any investigation by the FBI, nor are our contacts in law enforcement. While we would cooperate with any government investigation, we are not aware of any investigation regarding this topic nor have we been contacted by any government agency in this regard. We are not aware of any customer dropping Supermicro as a supplier for this type of issue. . . . Furthermore, Supermicro doesn’t design or manufacture networking chips or the associated firmware and we, as well as other leading server/storage companies, procure them from the same leading networking companies. These assertive statements are leading national security experts to question who exactly is telling the truth. If the Bloomberg story checks out, Amazon and Apple would seem to be lying and invalidating a potential national security risk. “If anything, there are only official denials on the story and the lack of technical details doesn’t really favor the conclusions from a technical standpoint,” said Andrea Barisani, head of hardware security at F-Secure, an antivirus and cybersecurity company. “It is certainly possible to mount supply chain attacks that can affect the security of COTS (Commercial Off The Shelf) hardware, albeit posing notable implementation difficulties.” I have to say, this is all really bizarre. The Bloomberg story is very detailed, citing documents and inside sources. But the company denials are also detailed and emphatic. You don't often see the latter when a company is trying to hide something or be coy. https://t.co/qjA1TFKzZ3 No one in Congress has called for an investigation into these allegations, but Republicans and Democrats alike have been wary of Chinese hardware use within the country’s borders. Ultimately, allegations this specific met with explicit denials like these may warrant further investigation. A deeper look into this potential attack wouldn’t be the first time members of Congress have criticized the use of Chinese hardware within the US. Over the summer, senators decided to include an amendment to a must-pass defense authorization bill banning the use of products by two other Chinese manufacturers (ZTE and Huawei) by government officials and contractors, citing national security concerns.

VERGE,This tiny turntable comes with a removable Bluetooth speaker,10/04/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/4/17937130/tiny-turntable-kickstarter-bluetooth-speaker-removable-duo," A new Kickstarter has popped up for a portable turntable with a detachable Bluetooth smart speaker. Called DUO, the hybrid design turns the idea of a traditional record player into a compact, multi-functional system. It’s a bright, fun-looking unit that sort of looks like if IKEA expanded its Teenage Engineering line to include a sewing machine. The top portion has the turntable, which has a reduced platter size that’s only 3.2 inches in diameter — one fourth the size of a standard platter. It uses a belt drive and the company says it has a “unique rotational stabilization” to help minimize vibrations and has a wow and flutter of less than .9 percent. (Wow and flutter is how much distortion there is when a turntable plays a record — generally a high-quality turntable has a wow and flutter rate of under .10 percent.) The player also comes with an Audio-Technica AT3600L cartridge and a tonearm with a spring instead of a counterweight that delivers a tracking force of 2.5 grams. As for the speaker, it has a range of 10 to 15 meters and when stored, slides nicely under the turntable to create one flush unit. It has a Qualcomm CSR8670 chip and uses the aptX Bluetooth compression protocol, which supports high-definition audio with a sample rate of up to 48 kHz and sample resolutions up to 24 bits. The speaker can be used independently of the turntable, and can switch from playing records to streaming audio. It’s also got a built-in Alexa functionality (so really, you could use it for more than just playing music). The speaker houses two full-range drivers and two low-frequency passive radiators, packed into a small 1.8 pound brick. If you nab a second speaker and press their Bluetooth buttons at the same time, DUO will automatically configure them into left and right channels for a stereo experience. The team behind DUO has previous experience in making turntables. Last year it released Seed, another combination product that incorporates a record player with an amplifier, loudspeaker, and more. The reviews for Seed are varied, with some saying it’s flawless, while others faced technical problems and had issues communicating with the company’s technical support. That said, if you want to preorder a DUO turntable, the early bird price is $219 with an estimated delivery date of December 2018. It theoretically will come in orange, yellow, and black, but there is a note on the Kickstarter page that the company will “send a survey for color choices after the campaign ends.”"
VERGE,The $349 Nokia 7.1 brings affordability to flagship phone specs,10/04/18,https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/4/17937078/nokia-7-1-flagship-phone-specs-price-android-oreo-pie," HMD Global has mostly been releasing midrange Nokia smartphones with a focus on Asian markets, but today, the company announced a new Nokia 7.1 device that will be released in the US and UK. The flagship smartphone, affordably priced at $349 (£299), will be available for preorder starting tomorrow on Amazon, Best Buy, or B&H, and it will start shipping on October 28th in the US and on the 17th in the UK. The 7.1 is the first phone to launch with “PureDisplay screen technology,” which can display HDR-quality images on its 5.84-inch notched display. It can support HDR 10 and also convert SDR to HDR in real time. Specs-wise, the Nokia 7.1 runs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 processor, and it has 12MP / 5MP dual cameras that can take Nokia-branded “Bothie” photos. (That essentially means you can take a photo simultaneously from the front and back-facing cameras, which are powered by ZEISS Optics.) The phone, like most of the other phones in the Nokia smartphone lineup, is in Google’s Android One program, which guarantees it’ll keep getting OS updates for two years. It runs Android Oreo straight out of the box, but it will be available to upgrade to Android Pie in November. That means you’ll be able to use Android Pie’s adaptive battery feature, which will help you stretch out the 3,060mAh battery. The Nokia 7.1 charges on a USB-C port, but don’t worry, it has a 3.5mm headphone jack, so you can breathe easy.  In addition to the 7.1, HMD is also releasing two new Nokia accessories: True Wireless earbuds and the Nokia Pro Wireless Earphones. The True Wireless earbuds offer 3.5 hours of play time, are waterproof, and can get three charges from the wireless charging case. The Pro Wireless are connected to neckbuds and can offer 10 hours of playback. Both can be used to answer calls without having to take your phone out. The Nokia 7.1 will come in two colors: “gloss midnight blue” and “gloss steel.” It’ll be available in a 32GB variant in the UK for €319 or 64GB for €349, while the US will only get the 64GB version for $349."
VERGE,Verizon ends sales of Google’s Pixel 2 as October 9th event nears,10/04/18,https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/4/17937138/verizon-stops-selling-google-pixel-2," Verizon no longer sells Google’s Pixel 2 smartphone, ending the device’s retail run just days before the Pixel 3 and 3 XL are due to be announced in New York City. Droid Life first noticed the change. Verizon was still selling the five-inch Pixel 2 as recently as late last month, according to the Internet Archive. Google continues to offer the unlocked device, but only in the 64GB storage option. The retail EOL (end of life) is evidence that Google (or at least Verizon) won’t be keeping the Pixel 2 around as a lower-priced alternative to the 3.  The Pixel 2 XL remains available for purchase online in both colors and storage capacities, though a check of in-store inventory shows that supply at Verizon’s retail locations is dwindling as the carrier makes room for two sizes of Google’s latest flagship. The Pixel 2 was released on October 19th last year, and as with the original Pixel phones, Verizon was the exclusive US carrier. It’s expected that the company will retain that exclusivity clause for a third year in a row when the Pixel 3 is unveiled on October 9th.  The smaller-sized Pixel had a lower resolution (1080p) screen and smaller battery than the XL variant (and larger bezels). But some chose it for its one-handed ease of use and the Samsung-made OLED panel — especially after controversy arose over LG’s screens in the 2 XL in the weeks immediately following launch. The 2 XL display ended up being just fine, but the regular 2 was a really great compact device. "
VERGE,Vizio nears $17 million settlement for TV data-tracking lawsuit,10/04/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/4/17937052/vizio-17-million-settlement-tv-data-tracking-lawsuit," Vizio may be reaching a settlement in its TV data-tracking class action lawsuit, in which the TV company could pay up $17 million in response to tracking its customers’ viewing habits (discovered back in early 2017), although the deal is subject to final approval.  Since it was first discovered that Vizio was spying on its users’ viewing habits, the company already paid $2.2 million to the Federal Trade Commission in a previous settlement in 2017, in addition to promising that it would ask permission from users before tracking viewing habits and demographic data to sell to advertisers.  According to Vizio, the tracking could have impacted roughly 16 million Vizio customers in the US who used their smart TVs between February 1st, 2014, and February 6th, 2017. (That makes the $17 million sum a bit less exciting if it’s divided up among all those customers.) Additionally, as part of the settlement, Vizio is agreeing to update its prompt for opting out of tracking, changing the language from “agree/settings” to “accept/decline.” It will also add an additional disclosure in the quick start guide that’s included with new TVs, and, most importantly, it will delete all the viewing data it collected prior to February 6th, 2017, when the data tracking was first discovered."
VERGE,Instagram’s Nametag feature makes it easier to follow people you meet IRL,10/04/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/4/17935942/instagram-nametag-qr-code-scan-follow-account," Instagram is rolling out a new way to quickly follow people you’ve met in real life. Called Nametag, the feature works by showing your username on your phone in a format that allows it to be scanned by your soon-to-be follower. This tag can also be customized with additional designs, colors, and stickers.  Similar functionality is already available across other social media networks. Twitter, Facebook, and Snapchat users can generate QR codes for others to scan and quickly find accounts, while Spotify offers the same for music tracks.  To use the feature, you can go to your profile, hit the menu button on the top right, and select “Nametag” to display your own code. When you want to scan someone else’s code, you can do so by swiping right into the camera, focusing on the tag, and holding down on the screen.  Nametag is launching globally starting today, and it’s available on both iOS and Android.  Alongside Nametag, Instagram is also testing a new bio field at some US universities, which will allow you to add your school, class year, and society memberships. Searching for this information will then show you a directory of everyone at that institution, making it easier to find and add classmates… and for Facebook to gather more information about you.   "
VERGE,New Pixel 3 leak hints at pink ‘sand’ color,10/04/18,https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/4/17936902/new-pixel-3-leak-pink-sand-color-mint-google," We’re just a few days away from Google officially announcing the Pixel 3, but that doesn’t mean we’re out of leaks yet. The latest from Android Headlines shows off renders for an as-yet-unseen “sand” (read: pink) color, joining the previously leaked black and white models.  But what’s interesting about this leak (aside from its almost uncomfortably flesh-toned appearance in these renders) is that an earlier hint from Google had previously indicated that the third Pixel 3 color would be a green-toned mint (which would also match its latest Google Home Mini color option). That said, unlike the pink sand model, there’s still no sign (either in render or leaked hardware) of a mint model. Will Google only offer the black, white, and sand options? Is mint real? We’ll presumably find out for sure next week."
VERGE,Google Assistant now helps you compare ride-hailing prices and summon a car,10/04/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/4/17936536/google-assistant-uber-lyft," After announcing some updates to the Google Assistant user experience yesterday, today Google is rolling out a new way of booking rides with your voice — or at least getting most of the way there. Starting this week, you’ll be able to say “Hey Google, book a ride to” or “Hey Google, get me a taxi to” your destination. Assistant will then respond by listing off price estimates and current wait times for Uber, Lyft, Ola, Grab, GO-JEK, “and many more” ride-hailing apps, according to Google. You can avoid the longer list and specify your preferred service by using its name when requesting a ride. This works on Android, iPhone, Google Home, and all other smart speakers that have Assistant built in. Support for smart displays is coming soon.  Previously, Assistant would kick you over to Google Maps for this info, as it already lists these price estimates for the services. Now it’s basically just surfacing that same information right in the Assistant window.  But ultimately, you’ll still need to pull out your phone to finalize things and get a car headed your way through that company’s respective app. Google says the new ride requests will be available “first in English and any country where one of our supported ride service partners operate. We plan to expand to more languages in the coming months.” Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant also supports Uber hailing, and it lets you actually summon a car without requiring any confirmation with your smartphone. But reviews on how well the skill works are pretty mixed. "
VERGE,Fitbit data used to charge suspect with murder,10/04/18,https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/4/17936722/fitbit-data-murder-trial-stepdaughter," Heart rate data from a Fitbit has been used to charge a man with the murder of his stepdaughter, reports The New York Times. Anthony Aiello had initially claimed that he had left his stepdaughter Karen Navarra’s home within 15 minutes of arriving. However, data from her Fitbit was later compared against security camera footage to prove that her murder occurred while Aiello was still at the property.  The data the Fitbit provided to detectives (in response to a search warrant) showed Navarra’s heart rate spiked at 3:20PM before rapidly declining and stopping completely at 3:28PM. Detectives later discovered bloodstained clothes at Aiello’s property, and he was arrested on September 25th.  Data from wearables and smart home devices is proving to be increasingly important to investigators as they attempt to solve crimes that lack reliable witnesses. The NYT cites a 2017 Connecticut trial in which Fitbit data was used to charge a man with the murder of his wife. Investigators also requested data from an Amazon Echo in 2017 in connection with a murder that the speaker’s microphones may have overheard.  In Fitbit’s case, it handed over the data from its user’s fitness tracker without issue. The company’s privacy policy explicitly says that it uses the data it collects “to promote the safety and security of ... our users, and other parties.” It says that it “may use the information to ... respond to a legal request.” Although Amazon agreed to provide subscriber and account information for the Echo device in the murder case, it initially refused to provide the communication data, arguing that voice interactions with Alexa were protected by the First Amendment. The company would later hand over the data at the request of the Echo’s owner, the case’s defendant, after which the charge was dismissed by a judge.  Fitbit’s data has already proven to be a valuable tool for bringing criminals to justice. And as we allow devices to have more and more access to our lives, biometric data cases like this are only going to increase. "
GADGETS,Google Appeals Record EUR 4.3 Billion EU Fine Over Android,10/10/18,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/google-appeals-record-eur-4-3-billion-eu-fine-over-android-1929609,"Google on Tuesday appealed the biggest ever anti-trust fine by the EU, which imposed an EUR 4.34 billion ($5 billion or roughly Rs. 37,100 crores) penalty on the US tech giant for illegally abusing the dominance of its operating system for mobile devices. In an email to AFP, Google spokesman Al Verney confirmed that ""we have now filed our appeal of the European Commission's Android decision at the General Court of the European Union."" In its July decision, Brussels accused Google of using the Android system's huge popularity on smartphones and tablets to promote the use of its own Google search engine and shut out rivals. EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager ordered Google to ""put an effective end to this conduct within 90 days or face penalty payments"" of up to five percent of its average daily turnover. The sanction nearly doubled the previous record EU antitrust fine of EUR 2.4 billion, which also targeted Google, in that case for the Silicon Valley titan's shopping comparison service in 2017. Google provides Android free to smartphone manufacturers and generates most of its revenue from selling advertisements that appear along with search results. But Vestager said Google had shut out rivals by forcing major phone makers including South Korea's Samsung and China's Huawei to pre-install its search engine and Google Chrome browser. They were also made to set Google Search as the default, as a condition of licensing some Google apps. As a result, Google Search and Chrome are pre-installed on the ""significant majority"" of devices sold in the EU, the European Commission says. Google CEO Sundar Pichai in July refuted the accusations arguing that the decision ignores the fact that Android phones compete with Apple phones that run on iOS with their own pre-installed apps. The EU decision ""rejects the business model that supports Android, which has created more choice for everyone, not less,"" Pichai added in a blog post. But according to industry-tracker Gartner, Android dominated the smartphone market with a share of 85.9 percent last year, to around 14 percent for Apple's iOS. Some 1.3 billion Android smartphones were sold last year, compared with approximately 215 million running on iOS and 1.5 million with other operating systems, according to the research firm. The appeal could take years to snake its way through the EU court system. © Thomson Reuters 2018 "

Their appointments will expand the size of the board to 14 and comes at a time when the US smartphone chipmaker has been looking to appease shareholders who withheld voting support for its board in March. Qualcomm has been forced to defend its track record this year after upsetting some investors by rebuffing a $117 billion takeover bid from rival Broadcom, failing to secure Chinese regulatory approval for its $44 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV, and failing to resolve a longstanding patent dispute with Apple. Reuters reported in September that Qualcomm was preparing to add at least two new directors to its board and that Rosenfeld and Anstice were in advanced talks for the positions. Qualcomm had re-elected its board of directors in March with tepid support from shareholders where some of the directors, including Qualcomm Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf, received support in the range of 40 percent to 50 percent. © Thomson Reuters 2018 "

The Chinese company has confirmed the new development through a couple of teasers posted on Weibo. The new smartphone, which is expected to have an in-display fingerprint sensor and a waterdrop display notch design, recently surfaced on TENAA as a suspicious new smartphone by the company with a 6.4-inch display and an octa-core SoC. The TENAA website showed three different variants of the Oppo K1, though the official teasers don't reveal any details around the distinct features available through the different variants. Oppo has separately teased the launch of a Hyper Boost technology that could enhance the overall performance of its future smartphones - perhaps similar to Huawei's GPU Turbo tech. The new technology could be a part of the Oppo K1, though it could debut on other models over time. As confirmed through the teasers posted on Weibo, the Oppo K1 is set to debut on October 11 along with an in-display fingerprint sensor and a waterdrop design. One of the teasers also suggests that the Oppo K1 will be priced between CNY 1,000 and CNY 1,999 (roughly between Rs. 10,750 and Rs. 21,500). This is significantly lower than the premium offerings, including the Vivo Nex and Xiaomi Mi 8 SE.  Photo Credit: Weibo/ Oppo   If we look at the TENAA listings, the Oppo K1 will come with a 6.4-inch full-HD+ (1080x2340 pixels) AMOLED display and will come with an octa-core SoC clocked at 1.95GHz. There could also be a dual rear camera setup along with a 16-megapixel primary sensor and a 2-megapixel secondary sensor and a 25-megapixel selfie camera. The TENAA listings also revealed Android 8.1 Oreo and 3,500mAh battery. The dimensions of all the Oppo K1 variants surfaced on TENAA are the same with 158.3x75.5x7.4mm of measurement and 156 grams of weight. However, there are likely to be some distinction on the RAM and onboard storage front as the TENAA site showed the smartphone in 6GB RAM and 64GB storage as well as 4GB RAM and 128GB storage option. The TENAA listings didn't reveal any details around the chipset powering the Oppo K1. Nevertheless, a listing on Geekbench has apparently showed the handset with a Snapdragon 660 SoC. Ahead of the formal launch of the Oppo K1, an alleged image showing its frontal panel has been leaked. The image, as shared by Chinese site MyDrivers, shows the waterdrop display notch of the upcoming Oppo smartphone. It also highlights the thin bezels surrounding the display panel. The overall design spotted in the leaked image shows some similarities with the Oppo R17 that was launched in August with a waterdrop notch.  Photo Credit: Weibo/ MyDrivers   Separately, Oppo has released a teaser through its Weibo account that shows the debut of its Hyper Boost technology on October 11. The technology, which is touted to bring overall acceleration, appears to be an answer to Huawei's GPU Turbo that accelerates the performance for heavy usage. Furthermore, it is expected to come preloaded on the Oppo K1 since it is launching alongside the handset at the Shanghai event.  Photo Credit: Weibo/ Oppo   The official teaser shows that there will be a dedicated briefing about the Hyper Boost technology where all its features are likely to be detailed. Meanwhile, you could expect some leaks related to the Oppo K1. "

Though Google has succeeded in selling lower-priced devices such as smart speakers and home routers, the phones have been a tougher sell. Google shipped 2.53 million Pixel 2 and 2 XL devices through the nine months ended June 30, garnering less than 1 percent of the global market for smartphones, according to research firm Strategy Analytics. The first Pixel devices reached 2.4 million shipments in the nine months ended June 30, 2017, the firm said. Limited adoption has reflected Google's hesitancy to go as wide and big in distributing and marketing the Pixel as Apple, which launched its last two iPhone line-ups in about 50 countries. Going from a small experiment to a polished product backed by large sales, support and technical teams has been part of Google's challenge. Last year's Pixel 2 arrived with bugs that prompted user complaints about unwanted noises during calls, a crashing camera app and an unexpected screen tint. Google initially sold the Pixel 2 and its larger-sibling, Pixel 2 XL, in six countries, including the United States, Australia, Germany and India, after an unveiling in San Francisco. This year, Google is hosting events for the Pixel 3 in cities such as New York, London, Paris, Tokyo and Singapore, spokesman Kay Oberbeck said. Google Assistant, the signature virtual helper feature on the Pixel that was available in six languages a year ago, now supports 16. Privacy and security features also could be top talking points about the Pixel 3 as Google and other big US tech companies try to bounce back from recent data breach scandals. A US regulatory filing points to Google's matching on Tuesday rivals Amazon.com and Facebook with a smart speaker that has a display to show visual responses to voice commands. Amazon shipped 21.5 million smart speakers, including those with displays, in the year ended June 30, compared with 18.3 million for Google, according to research firm Canalys. © Thomson Reuters 2018 "

GADGETS,"Xiaomi Addresses Poco F1 Screen Bleeding Issue, Claims Only 0.3 Percent Users Affected by Edge Light Dispersion",10/09/18,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/poco-f1-screen-bleeding-issue-addressed-miui-10-update-1929099,"Xiaomi says that the bleeding issue ""does not affect the performance or usability"" of Poco F1 Xiaomi has finally addressed the ""screen bleeding"" issue on the Poco F1 and announced the removal of the default gradient screen feature through a MIUI 10 update. The Chinese company has also claimed that the bleeding issue comes due to a bright gradient on the bottom of the display on certain Poco F1 screens and the gradient is a part of the MIUI for Poco skin. Additionally, the company has admitted that less than 0.3 percent of the total Poco F1 users have experienced edge light dispersion. However, it believes that the issue ""does not affect the performance or usability"" of the smartphone. Various affected users last month complained about the bleeding issue that surfaced days after the handset was found to have no support for Widevine L1 that enables HD video streaming through services such as Amazon Prime Video and Netflix. The screen-centric issue emerged not just on the Poco F1 units in India but also in Indonesia. ""Recently, a few Poco F1 users mentioned they experienced 'screen bleeding', owing to a bright gradient on the bottom of the display on certain screens. We would like to clarify that certain screens on MIUI 9 (MIUI for Poco) feature a gradient by design (including the power screen), and this is not screen bleeding. Further, this gradient screen has been removed from MIUI 10 onwards,"" the company said in a statement posted by the official Poco India account on Twitter. Elaborating the edge light dispersion that some users reported last month, the statement said that ""less than 0.3 percent"" of the total Poco F1 users had experienced the issue. The company, however, affirms that the issue doesn't affect the performance of usability of the smartphone ""in any manner whatsoever."" ""We would encourage users to walk in to any of our 1,000+ service centres and get their Poco F1 examined by an expert if they are facing any irregularities,"" the company added. According to user complaints surfaced last month, the screen bleeding issue is evident on the bottom edge of the Poco F1 display where an odd illumination can be seen after increasing brightness in the dark. To recall, the Poco F1 was launched in India back in August with a starting price of Rs. 20,999. The smartphone is essentially designed to take on the likes of the OnePlus 6 with a 6.18-inch full-HD+ (1080x2246 pixels) display and a Snapdragon 845 SoC. It also has a dual camera setup at the back along with a 12-megapixel primary sensor and a 5-megapixel secondary sensor and a 20-megapixel selfie camera. Xiaomi Poco F1 Review Just days after the launch of the Poco F1 in August, the handset was also found to have the absence of Widevine L1 DRM support that is necessary to enable HD video streaming through services such as Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, and Google Play.   "

GADGETS,"Google Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL Price, Colour Variants, Camera Features Leaked; Official Teaser Makes Fun of Leaks",10/09/18,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/google-pixel-3-xl-retail-box-price-colour-variants-camera-features-leaked-teaser-video-1929078,"Photo Credit: Twitter/ This Is Tech Today Last minute leaks of Google Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL have surfaced on the Web Google Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL have emerged as one of the most anticipated smartphones of 2018. While both new smartphones are about to debut globally, the last minute leaks highlighting some of the key features of the two new Pixel models have surfaced on the Web to detail what Google has cooked up behind the scenes. Few images, once again showing the design of the Pixel 3 XL, have leaked on Twitter. The Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL price have also been leaked. Separately, artificial intelligence (AI) backed camera features of the Pixel 3 have been spotted. The handset is reported to have options such as 'Top Shot', 'Photobooth', and 'Super res zoom'. Screen specifications and colour variants of the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL have been spotted through official-looking pamphlets. The handsets are found to have Clearly White, Just Black, and Not Pink colour options. Renders showing the new Pixel models in all these three colour options have also been outed. An official Pixel 3 case has also been revealed that features a fabric design. Aside from the last-minute revelations, Google has officially released a video that takes a jibe at all the leaks. Tipster This Is Tech Today on Twitter leaked an alleged Pixel 3 XL image along with its retail box. The images show the same handset that was outed in previous leaks as well. However, the Twitter user also reveals the prices of the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL. While the former is said to carry a price tag of GBP 749 (roughly Rs. 72,500), the latter is said to be priced at GBP 869 (roughly Rs. 84,100). These could be the prices of the top-end variants of the new Pixel models. Notably, the prices aren't in line with the recently leaked Canadian prices of the Pixel 3 handsets. There is also a GBP 70 (roughly Rs. 6,800) increase when compared with the launch price of the Pixel 2 XL. We certainly need to wait for the formal launch to see the difference. Apart from the prices, the tipster claims that the over last year's Pixel handsets, the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL have notable improvements on the part of the display and other hardware. The dual selfie camera setup on both smartphones has also been reiterated, though this time it is said to have a wide-angle and normal set of lenses. Popular tipster Evan Blass has separately leaked an image that combines all the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL renders. These are showing the Pixel 3 models in three colour options as well as revealing the official ""3"" wallpaper that carries the October 9 date to match the launch schedule. The stock wallpaper presumably matches the colour option of Pixel 3 handset. This means if you look at the White Pixel 3, it has the wallpaper in White, while the Black variant has the wallpaper in Black.  Photo Credit: Twitter/ Evan Blass   Coming towards the three colour options of the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL, these are found to be officially called Clearly White, Just Black, and Not Pink, as spotted in official-looking pamphlets by GSMArena. The renders featured in the image shared by Blass further detail each colour variant. There is a matte finish at the back along with a glossy, frosted glass area covering the top of the rear panel - similar to the Pixel 2 models. The power/ lock button on the Pixel 3 also has new colour treatment. While the Black variant of the Pixel 3 is spotted a Black power/ lock key, the White variant has a Teal-coloured power button and the Not Pink variant has a dark Pink button. The pamphlet also gives a brief information about the display of the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL. The Pixel 3 is found to have a 5.5-inch full-HD (1080p) display, whereas the Pixel 3 XL appears to have a 6.3-inch full-HD (1080p) display. The resolution is notably not in line with what was leaked previously. The Pixel 3 XL was previously expected to have a QHD+ (1440x2880 pixels) resolution, though the Pixel 3 was rumoured to have a full-HD+ (1080x2160 pixels) resolution. As reported by Android Police, an official Pixel 3 case has been spotted at Target with a fabric design. The case has a two-tone colour and a mesh-like finish that matches the fabric of the Google Home speakers. It seems like the case is designed to match the Not Pink colour variant of the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL. Further, it is closest to the Coral Pixel 2 case with a darker colour and cutouts matching the next-gen Pixel models. The case protects the side-mounted volume rocker and the power/ lock key alongside protecting the back of the Pixel phones. Price of the Pixel 3 case is a mystery, though the fabric cases for the Pixel 2 are available for purchase in the US at $40 (roughly Rs. 3,000).  Photo Credit: AndroidPolice   Folks at 9to5Google have separately leaked all the major camera features of the Pixel 3. It is reported that the Pixel 3 will exclusively have a feature called Top Shot that will capture a burst of frames after pressing the shutter button. This will help the machine learning-backed system to find the best photos from the array of shots. It is said that the feature will take into consideration various factors, including smiles, open eyes, and the attention of the subject. The camera could also suggest the best from multiple shots through a Smart Capture suggestion pill, though users are also said to have the option to swipe up on a photo to see the their ""Smart captures"". The Pixel 3 is also reported to have a Photobooth feature that will automatically find the best selfies. It is said to work similar to how Google Clips camera captures clips using AI algorithms. Further, the new Pixel models are likely to include a Super res zoom feature that will enable an AI zoom - without requiring a secondary camera sensor. For selfie-obsessed users, the Pixel 3 is said to have a Super Selfies camera that will use the wide-angle camera of the dual selfie camera setup to capture ""more in a standard selfie"". The new Pixel is additionally reported to have a subject tracking autofocus functionality that will track subjects in view without requiring users to manually tap the screen to focus on a particular subject in the frame. There could also be the existing features such as Face Retouching with options for Soft and Normal shots and Motion Photos, slow-motion video, panorama, and AR stickers. Moreover, the interface of the Google Camera app is also found to be redesigned with the option to switch different available modes by swiping the screen.  Photo Credit: 9to5Google   In addition to all the major leaks that emerged at the time of filing this story, Google has released a short video that teases the Pixel 3 launch by making fun of all the leaks and rumours. The video that has been posted on Twitter via Made by Google account shows clips of a handful of tech reports and YouTubers to mock the leaks.   So you think you know… Tune in tomorrow to see for yourself. https://t.co/4zTwRXcn1x #madebygoogle pic.twitter.com/3IO3xaMaP8   Google also teases some unannounced details in an accompanying tweet by saying ""So you think you know..."" This suggests that alongside the Pixel 3 handsets, the search giant could have some new devices at its Pixel event later today. However, we certainly need to wait until the formal launch to see what all Google has to take on the likes of Apple and Samsung that already brought their this year's flagships. "

GADGETS,"iOS 12.0.1 Released With Fixes for iPhone XS Lightning Cable Charging Issue, Wi-Fi Bug, and More: How to Download and Install",10/09/18,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/apple-ios-12-0-1-charge-gate-lightning-cable-issue-bugs-wi-fi-ipad-keyboard-1929028,"iOS 12.0.1 update can be installed by going into Settings > General > Software Update Apple has released the latest iOS 12.0.1 software update that brings bug fixes, primarily for the newly launched iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max flagship models. With the update, Apple has fixed the “charge-gate” scandal by fixing the issue where some iPhone XS devices did not immediately charge when connected to a Lightning cable. This issue meant users had to manually wake up the screen in order to get it to start charging. It also fixes certain other Wi-Fi and keyboard issues. With the file size of about 86MB (depending on handset), the iOS 12.0.1 update can be installed by going into Settings > General > Software Update. The changelog of iOS 12.0.1 on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch models details a fix for the Lightning cable charge issue on the latest iPhone models, and resolution for an issue that could cause iPhone XS devices to rejoin a Wi-Fi network at 2.4GHz (single-band) instead of 5GHz (dual-band). There is no mention of a fix for LTE connectivity issues that users also reported alongside Wi-Fi issues. The update also restores the original position of the “.?123” key on the iPad keyboard, fixes an issue where subtitles may not appear in some video apps, and addresses an issue where Bluetooth could become unavailable. An earpiece speaker issue reported by some users also appears to have remain unaddressed. As per the changelog, this seems to be a minor upgrade given the version number but offers respite to users who have complained about the Lightning cable issue since the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max were released late last month. This is also the first stable update ever since iOS 12 dropped after the iPhone launch last month. The iOS 12.1 public beta update was released a couple of weeks back that brought the much-awaited Group FaceTime feature with support for up to 32 users in a single call, support for clickable thumb sticks on MFi gamepads, and more. The stable version of iOS 12.1 might soon bring these features to a wider audience. Additionally, a report last week claimed that iOS 12 is now running on more Apple devices than iOS 11. The latest version of iOS is reportedly installed on over 47 percent of active iOS devices worldwide, while iOS 11 has its presence on over 45 percent of devices.  "

GADGETS,Huawei Unveils Ultra-Fast Charging Lithium-Silicon Battery,10/08/18,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/huawei-unveils-ultra-fast-charging-lithium-silicon-battery-1928743,"Aiming to achieve a breakthrough in battery life, Huawei Consumer Business Group on Monday unveiled the industry's first patented lithium-silicon battery that promises to greatly improve fast-charging capability and ensures safety. This patented technology is an iteration of the battery that is likely to be used in upcoming Huawei smartphones, the company said in a statement. The silicon anodes in the Lithium-Silicon battery hold more power than graphite-based versions, thus making the battery more durable and increasing its power-retention capacity. ""Just like how multi-touch technology changed the way displays work, Huawei's ultra-fast charging technologies will redefine the way people use smartphones and free users from nomophobia - the fear of having no access to phones,"" said the company. The new batteries are coated with a 3D nitrogen-doped carbon network and this coating can be synthesised at a relatively lower temperature and has high conductivity, resulting in ultra-fast charging. Unlike traditional fast-charging solutions, ultra-fast technology employs a relatively low-voltage and high-current formula that aims to maximise the amount of current going into the device while minimizing efficiency losses, heat as well as throttling. ""This innovation is based on electrochemical kinetics advancements, which enable ultra-fast charging batteries to support greater power efficiency and current input. Leveraging the nitrogen-doped carbon frame, Huawei improved the stability intercalation and deintercalation of lithium,"" the company added. The handset maker's ultra-fast charging battery is the result of material innovation and fully compatible with the existing battery solutions. "

GADGETS,OnePlus 6T Pre-Bookings Listing Allegedly Spotted on Amazon India; CEO Pete Lau Details Reasons for Headphone Jack Removal,10/08/18,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/oneplus-6t-pre-order-listing-amazon-india-free-bullets-type-c-amazon-pay-rs-500-ceo-pete-lau-screen-1928465,"Photo Credit: WinFuture OnePlus 6T will sport an in-display fingerprint sensor OnePlus 6T leaks have been on overdrive, with new renders leaked just last week. Now, this new week brings along a leaked listing on Amazon India that indicates that OnePlus 6T pre-orders will start from midnight tonight, and will offer freebies like OnePlus Bullets Type-C earphones and Rs. 500 Amazon Pay balance. This gift card listing was reportedly briefly listed on Amazon India, and has since been removed. OnePlus CEO Pete Lau also detailed the tough decision of removing the headphone jack to make room for the new Screen Unlock feature - the company's name for the in-display fingerprint scanner. The alleged Amazon listing was spotted by MySmartPrice, and it indicates that the pre-bookings will begin from midnight tonight. The listing states that the OnePlus 6T pre-bookings will go on till October 30 and customers who pre-book will get free OnePlus Bullets USB Type-C earphones and Rs. 500 Amazon Pay balance. OnePlus hasn't revealed any official date for the launch on the OnePlus 6T, but has been teasing the phone regularly. It is largely expected to launch on October 17. In an interview with CNET, CEO Pete Lau confirms that the smartphone will launch this month itself, a month earlier than traditional launches. Lau also asserts in the interview that removing the headphone jack was a tough decision to make. He claims that the decision had to be made to integrate the Screen Unlock feature. The fingerprint module stuck behind the display takes the necessary space left behind by the 3.5mm audio jack module. ""After you experience the Screen Unlock you'll fall in love with it, [You'll] realize that it's the experience that you wanted,"" Lau said about the trade-off.  MySmartPricePhoto Credit: OnePlus 6T pre-order listing on Amazon India   Lau notes that the in-display fingerprint sensor was expected to launch on the OnePlus 5T, but it wasn't ready up to the company's standards then. However, now the company believes that the Screen Unlock feature is ready for commercial usage. The report also states that the OnePlus 6T will be priced a little higher than the OnePlus 6, given the additions of Screen Unlock, bigger battery, and new notch structure. Finally, Lau notes that OnePlus is working hard on bringing wireless charging to future OnePlus devices. He said that Dash Charge is popular among users, and when the company's wireless charging can charge at that speed without dissipating heat, it will be launched. However, Lau doesn't think water resistance is a feature that is worth increasing the price of the device. ""The number of users that are taking their phone to go swimming are few and far between. To have everyone else pay, say, $30 more, 'for the sake of an IP rating' in order to accommodate the one user who goes off and swims with their phone is unreasonable,"" Lau explains. OnePlus 6T is tipped to feature a 6.4-inch Optic AMOLED full-HD+ display and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 SoC, coupled with 6GB and 8GB RAM options and up to 256GB of onboard storage. The smartphone is also reported to have a 3,700mAh battery that will be larger in capacity over the 3,300mAh battery available on the OnePlus 6. Moreover, the OnePlus 6T is expected to run Android 9.0 Pie out-of-the-box. "

GADGETS,"Moto G7 Leaked Renders, Video Show Waterdrop Display Notch and Camera Bump",10/07/18,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/moto-g7-leaked-renders-video-show-waterdrop-display-notch-and-camera-bump-1927440,"Moto G7 renders show a prominent chin at the bottom along with a Motorola branding Moto G7 has emerged on the Web through some CAD-based renders and a video, shortly after its specifications leaked online, . The renders and video of the Moto G7 shows its waterdrop display notch that was spotted in a leaked image recently. Also, there is the dual rear camera setup along with a bump that also has a room for an LED flash module. The back of the Moto G7 appears to have Motorola's batwing logo that is likely to have a fingerprint scanner underneath it. This looks similar to the fingerprint scanner of the Motorola One Power. Despite the latest renders and the previous leaks, the Moto G7 is unlikely to debut anytime this year. The handset, instead, is speculated to arrive sometime next year in four different models. The renders and video, courtesy OnLeaks in collaboration with MySmartPrice, show off the design of the Moto G7 that is distinguished from this year's Moto G6 - thanks to the waterdrop notch design. The presence of the display notch is likely to help the handset offer a higher screen-to-body ratio than its predecessor. However, there is a prominent chin at the bottom that carries the Motorola branding. On the back of the Moto G7, there is a glossy finish and the dual rear camera setup that is speculated to have a 16-megapixel primary sensor and a 5-megapixel secondary sensor. The camera setup is accompanied by an LED flash module. The renders show the availability of a 3.5mm headphone jack on the Moto G7, though there is also the USB Type-C port that sits alongside the loudspeaker grill. The back of the Moto G7 in the renders also highlight the fingerprint sensor that is hidden under the batwing logo. It is said that the Moto G7 will measure 157x75.3x8mm, though its camera bump could make it 9.5mm thick overall.   The renders and video are likely to be revealing the design of the standard Moto G7 model, though there could be some design changes on the other Moto G7 models, including the Moto G7 Play, Moto G7 Plus, and Moto G7 Power. If we look at the recent reports, the standard Moto G7 will come with a 6.4-inch full-HD+ (1080x2340 pixels) display. The smartphone could also have an octa-core SoC that could be the Snapdragon 660, coupled with 4GB of RAM. Also, it is rumoured to have a 12-megapixel selfie camera, 64GB of onboard storage, and a 3,500mAh battery. "

The OnePlus 6T is confirmed to sport an in-display fingerprint sensor as well. Renders suggest that the OnePlus 6T will sport a waterdrop-shaped notch and a dual camera setup stacked vertically at the back. Now, fresh renders have been leaked on case maker Olixar's website, with cases for the upcoming device already up for pre-order. Olixar has listed five cases on its website for pre-order, and these include FlexiShield OnePlus 6T Gel case, Ultra-Thin OnePlus 6T Gel case, ArmourDillo OnePlus 6T protective case, Sentinel OnePlus 6T case and glass screen protector, and Farley RFID Blocking OnePlus 6T Executive Wallet case. These cases show a waterdrop-shaped notch in the front indicating that the OnePlus 6T will have more screen-to-body ratio that the OnePlus 6 which sports a wide display notch. The vertically stacked dual camera setup sits in the top centre at the back of the OnePlus 6T, similar to that of its predecessor. This leak falls in line with all the previous render leaks so far. The case renders were first spotted by MySmartPrice. The in-display fingerprint scanner on the OnePlus 6T is being called Screen Unlock by the OnePlus 6T. It is tipped to sport a 6.4-inch Optic AMOLED full-HD+ display and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 SoC, coupled with 6GB and 8GB RAM options and up to 256GB of onboard storage. The smartphone is also reported to have a 3,700mAh battery that will be larger in capacity over the 3,300mAh battery available on the OnePlus 6. Moreover, the OnePlus 6T is expected to run Android 9.0 Pie out-of-the-box. CEO Pete Lau has also previously confirmed that the OnePlus 6T will not sport a headphone jack. "
GADGETS,Lenovo K8 Note Successor India Launch Expected at October 16 Event,10/05/18,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/lenovo-october-16-event-scheduled-k8-note-successor-1927486,"Lenovo's invite shows a smartphone with a possible metallic frame Lenovo is set to launch a new smartphone in India this month. The Chinese consumer electronics giant has sent out media invites for a launch event in New Delhi that is scheduled for October 16 in the country. While the invite does not reveal the name of the smartphone that will be unveiled at the event, it consists of the words 'The Killer Returns'. Based on the information, it is expected that the manufacturer will launch a successor to the Lenovo K8 Note. It has been more than more than a year that Lenovo has launched a smartphone in India. To recall, the company had launched the K8 Plus and K8 in September 2017. The last smartphone in Lenovo's K Note lineup was the K8 Note, which was launched in India in August last year. The company usually calls the smartphones in this series as 'Killer Note', which is why the invite sent by Lenovo hints at the launch of a new K Note-Series smartphone in the country. The invite does not reveal any information about the handset, but it shows a possible metallic frame and rounded corners. As mentioned, the launch date of the smartphone is October 16 and we can expect more details about the handset in the days leading up to the launch. It is worth mentioning that Lenovo had launched a few other smartphones in the K-Series after the K8-Series, but none of them made their way into India. Meanwhile, the company is set to launch the Lenovo Z5 Pro in China soon. The company may release either a rebranded version of the smartphone in India at the event, but it is highly unlikely. Since the smartphones in the K-Series fall in the mid-budget segment, if Lenovo launched the K8 Note successor, its price in India is expected to be in the Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 20,000 range. Other details on the new Lenovo smartphone are scarce at the moment, and we refrain from speculating right now, as we can expect more details about the upcoming handset in the next few days. "
GADGETS,iOS 12 Now Running on More Devices Than iOS 11: Mixpanel,10/05/18,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/ios-12-adoption-rate-install-base-surpass-ios-11-mixpanel-numbers-1927510,"Mixpanel claims that iOS 12 presently has an install base of 47.56 percent of active devices. Apple last month pleased a large number of iPhone and iPad users by releasing the anticipated iOS 12 update. But just a little over two weeks after its formal debut, iOS 12 is now reported to have surpassed iOS 11 in terms of install base. The latest version of iOS is installed on over 47 percent of the active iOS devices worldwide, as per the data provided by analytics firm Mixpanel. Interestingly, iOS 11, which was launched in September last year, is now a few points behind the fresh iOS version, having its presence on over 45 percent of devices. The adoption rate of iOS is always higher than that of Android since Apple releases the newest update for a lengthy list of iPhone and iPad models simultaneously. However, particularly in the case of iOS 12, the new software has presumably encouraged a large number of iPhone users thanks to the bunch of optimisations for dated hardware, including the five-year-old iPhone 5s. According to the latest numbers shared by Mixpanel, iOS 12 is installed on 47.56 percent of active devices, while iOS 11 is present on 45.58 percent of active devices. This shows the difference of 1.98 percent between the two iOS versions. Also, as many as 7.18 percent of devices are running a version older than iOS 11. Just to clarify, all devices running iOS 12 upgraded from iOS 11 and previous versions, excepting the models that launched with iOS 12 out-of-the-box - the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max. Thus, it is only natural that iOS 12 adoption rises, iOS 11 install base falls.  Photo Credit: Mixpanel   It is worth pointing out that Apple is yet to release the official adoption numbers of the new iOS version - it was last updated on September 3 - and they are likely to be slightly different from what Mixpanel is showing through its site. Having said that, one of the key reasons for the fast adoption of iOS 12 is the bundle of optimisations that it brings to enhance the overall experience. Apple claims that the new iOS enables the devices to launch apps up to twice as fast as on the last iOS update. Similarly, it is claimed that the camera launches up to 70 percent faster and the keyboard appears up to 50 percent faster. The official changelog of the new iOS version that was released on September 17 highlighted that all supported iOS 12 devices see the improved performance. 12 Awesome New Features in iOS 12 The compatibility of iOS 12 is also a major reason for its faster adoption as it supports the iPhone lineup starting from the iPhone 5s that was launched in September 2013 and iPad range beginning from the iPad Air that debuted in November 2013. This is unlike Google's Android 9.0 Pie that arrived on the Pixel devices and Essential Phone and recently reached the OnePlus 6 and Nokia 7 Plus.   "

GADGETS,"Huawei Mate 20 Leaked Press Images Show Off Waterdrop Notch, Triple Camera Setup",10/05/18,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/huawei-mate-20-alleged-press-renders-waterdrop-notch-triple-camera-setup-october-16-launch-1927480,"Photo Credit: WinFuture.de Huawei Mate 20 will reportedly not feature laser sensors for facial recognition Huawei Mate 20 and Mate 20 Pro, the Chinese phone maker’s upcoming flagship phablets, are all set to launch at an event scheduled for October 16 in London, UK. With just about a few days to go for the launch, most major specifications and features, along with design renders of the Mate 20 Pro, have been leaked. But, now, a new report has surfaced that gives us a look at what are the alleged press renders of the lesser-endowed sibling, Huawei Mate 20. The leaked images show a smaller, waterdrop-style notch and a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. The leaked images and specifications come to us via reputed tipster Roland Quandt who writes for German blog WinFuture.de. The report claims that the Huawei Mate 20 will sport a 6.43-inch full-HD+ TFT LCD panel with a resolution of 1080x2244 pixels and resulting aspect ratio of 18.7:9. Notably, the notch up top appears much smaller than the one leaked in images of the Huawei Mate 20 Pro last week. This has reportedly been made possible because Mate 20 will not feature laser sensors for facial recognition, like its better endowed sibling. The Huawei Mate 20 is expected to sport an octa-core HiSilicon Kirin 980 SoC, paired with 4GB/ 6GB/ 8GB of RAM and 64GB/ 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB of UFS 2.1 inbuilt storage. Storage will vary by country and network operator. As reported earlier, Huawei will introduce a new nanoSD card slot with expansion up to 128GB. There is expected to be a 4,000mAh battery under the hood. At the back of the smartphone, the Huawei Mate 20 will sport a triple camera setup much like the Mate 20 Pro. While it is reported to get a 40-megapixel primary sensor, specifications for the other two are not available yet. The phone is expected to retain the 3.5mm headphone jack, unlike the Mate 20 Pro. The report claims that the Huawei Mate 20 might not launch in all markets, although it will come to Germany. Also, the Mate 20 is expected to bear a starting price tag of EUR 750 (roughly Rs. 63,700), while the Mate 20 Pro might start at EUR 850 (about Rs. 72,200). Interestingly, a report out of Israel last month had claimed that the Mate 20 would sport a price tag of ILS 3,000 (around Rs. 61,000) while the Mate 20 Pro would be priced at ILS 4,000 (roughly Rs. 81,300), with availability in the country starting from October itself. Apart from that, Huawei is also expected to launch its first smartphone in India with a Kirin 980 SoC, by Q4 2018. This could be the Mate 20 series or also, possibly, another smartphone that Huawei has in the pipeline. "

Analysis firm Flurry analytics looked into device activations of the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max from September 21 to September 27 to estimate the first week sales of the new iPhone modes. Based on this data, the company claims that the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max's first week sales were much better than iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X combined first week sales last year. Flurry Analytics in its report said that Apple generated 7 percent more revenue during the first week sales of the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, compared to the combined sales of the iPhone X, iPhone 8, and iPhone 8 Plus during their first week. This indicates that the new Apple devices are a significant success even though the pricing graph continues to move upwards for revenue growth purposes. The overall sale numbers are expected to increase even more when iPhone XR goes on sale this month. To recall, the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus went on sale on September 22, 2017 in the first wave of launch markets, while the iPhone X went on sale on November 3, 2017. The iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max on the other hand went on sale on September 21 in the first wave of launch markets. ""From this comparison, taking unit sales of the different devices and multiplying them by the different prices from each time period, we estimate that Apple generated 7 percent more revenue during week one of the XS, XS Max and same-week incremental sales for the iPhone X (now offered at a discounted rate), compared to the combined sales of the 8, 8 Plus and original iPhone X during their respective first week,"" Flurry Analytics noted in its report. During their first full week, the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max gained a market share of 0.42 percent and 0.68 percent respectively, which makes it 1.1 percent combined. To compare, the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus devices combined claimed 0.76 percent percent share of the Apple device base in the first week of sales last year. By comparison, the XS and XS Max captured 45 percent more share, which is a strong improvement. The takeaway here is that Apple is able to drive solid market share even after increasing the prices of its new iPhone models. Flurry Analytics notes that the trend is expected to continue all throughout the holiday season. Lastly, the company says that the iPhone 7 is on the top position when it comes to market penetration. ""In terms of market penetration, the iPhone 7 (15.40 percent) is the #1 iPhone model currently. The iPhone 7 Plus (12.73 percent) is #2, followed by the iPhone 6S (12.40 percent),"" the report states. TF Industries analyst Ming-Chi Kuo expects total shipments of all the three variants is expected to grow slightly year on year to 75-80 million units for 2018 holiday quarter.

GADGETS,"iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max Earpiece Speaker Randomly Stops Working, Some Users Complain",10/05/18,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/apple-iphone-xs-max-earpiece-speaker-issue-1927287,"The issue isn't affecting voice calling on the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max While Apple is yet to acknowledge the charging issues reported by some users, the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max are now said to have an issue with the earpiece speaker that randomly stops functioning. Once again reported by some users, the issue reportedly doesn't emerge during voice calls, though it impacts music playback on the latest iPhone models. The affected users have reported the problem on the Apple Community site as well as explained its presence in multiple tweets and Reddit threads. It appears that the issue comes through a software bug since it doesn't impact voice calls, and a reboot fixes the problem temporarily. To recall, like most recent iPhone models, the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max feature stereo speakers, with one located in the earpiece, and the other at the bottom panel of the smartphones. Some users have complained about the earpiece speaker issue on the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max. The issue essentially impacts the stereo audio playback functionality of the latest iPhone models as it suddenly stops the earpiece speaker from playing the audio. ""I just got my [iPhone] XS Max couple of days ago, and when I was playing a song through Spotify, I noticed it was only playing through one channel,"" one of the affected users wrote in a post on the Apple Community site. Similar complaints are spread across Reddit and Twitter. The reports were first highlighted by PiunikaWeb. Some users have found a reboot as a temporary fix. However, the issue reoccurs after some time in most of the cases. The problem notably hasn't been noticed during voice calls. This suggests that there could be a software bug creating the issue. Furthermore, it appears that the issue is largely impacting the iPhone XS Max as there are comparatively a fewer iPhone XS users who have so far complained about the faulty earpiece speaker. One of the affected users has even uploaded a video on YouTube to detail the issue. The video shows that the top speaker on an iPhone XS Max doesn't function while playing a video on YouTube. The narrator in the video says that he reached out to Apple, but the company told him to do a factory reset that didn't solve the problem.   Apple hasn't yet acknowledged the issue. Having said that, an iOS update can be expected to fix the bug. Some users on the iOS 12.1 beta, however, reported that the issue persists on the latest iOS build as well. We've reached out to Apple for a comment on the issue and will update this space accordingly. Meanwhile, as some users noticed, if you're facing the earpiece speaker bug on your iPhone XS or iPhone XS Max, you can perform a reboot to temporarily fix the issue.   "

The Samsung Galaxy S9+ gets a new Burgundy Red colour variant, while the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 gets a Lavender Purple colour variant. To recall, the Burgundy Red colour variant was launched globally back in May, for both the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+ models. The Galaxy Note 9, on the other hand, had its Lavender Purple colour which was announced at its global launch in August itself, but is only now making its way to India. The company has also announced cashback offers, an additional exchange bonus, and a discount on the Galaxy Watch. Both new colour variants become available to buy on Thursday itself, via select offline stores, online portals, and the Samsung Shop. The Samsung Galaxy Note 9 had been launched in Metallic Copper, Midnight Black, and Ocean Blue colour variants in India. Thus, the smartphone is now offered in four colour variants in the country.

GADGETS,"Samsung Q3 Profit Likely Hit Record High, but Chip Price Fall Casts Shadow",10/05/18,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/samsung-q3-profit-likely-hit-record-high-but-chip-price-fall-casts-shadow-1927262,"Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and Galaxy Watch are seen displayed during a product launch event in Brooklyn, US Samsung Electronics Co said quarterly operating profit likely surged by a fifth to a record high, with its chip unit bolstered by robust demand from data centres and gains in production yields. But sharp price slides for some types of semiconductors have brought an end to a two-year super cycle of tight supply and soaring demand, and analysts expect the July-September quarter will mark a peak in earnings for the South Korean tech giant. The world's top maker of memory chips and smartphones said a preliminary estimate showed third-quarter profit jumped 20.4 percent to KRW 17.5 trillion ($15.5 billion) on a 4.8 percent gain in revenue, in line with market expectations. That would beat operating profit growth of 6 percent in the previous quarter when its Galaxy S9 device missed sales targets and competition from cheaper Chinese-made phones ate into margins for its mobile business. The firm did not elaborate on its performance and will disclose detailed earnings in late October. Chips account for nearly 80 percent of Samsung's operating profit and Samsung has benefited from a surge in data centres for cloud computing that has spurred spikes in prices for DRAM chips. DRAM chips, which help devices perform multiple tasks, are its main memory product. It has also made gains in production technology that allow it to make smaller and faster chips per silicon wafer. But prices for NAND chips used for longer-term data storage have tumbled as supply swamps demand, and prices for DRAM are expected to follow suit. ""Its earnings appeared to have peaked,"" said William Park, a senior analyst at Mirae Asset Daewoo Securities. ""DRAM prices are going to fall, although not dramatically, and that will negatively impact its margins."" Song Myung-sup, a senior analyst at HI Investment & Securities, expects DRAM chip prices to slide about 5 percent in the fourth quarter from the previous quarter, while NAND chip prices are seen dropping 10 percent. Samsung is forecast to still book decent operating profit growth of 12 percent in the fourth quarter, Refinitiv data shows. But that is seen dropping to minimal profit growth in the first half of 2019 followed by small profit declines in the second half. Shares in Samsung edged up 0.2 percent on Friday morning, while the broader market fell slightly. The stock has lost 12 percent so far this year on concerns about chip prices, underperforming the broader market which has declined 8 percent. While income levels for Samsung's business divisions are yet to be disclosed, analysts expect its mobile business will struggle to deliver profit growth for the next two quarters due to high marketing costs in the premium smartphone segment and competition from cheaper Chinese-made models. It is working on bringing phones with bendable screens to market but they are not expected to become a huge profit driver. ""Its mobile division will continue to look bad. Samsung's upcoming foldable phones are not going to be meaningful in terms of sales, more of a symbolic move in terms of innovation,"" said Park Sung-soon, an analyst at BNK Securities. © Thomson Reuters 2018 "

The addition of the Power model in the new lineup is likely to bring a massive battery option in the lineup. Hardware details of the Moto G7 Play, Moto G7 Plus, and Moto G7 Power are yet to be revealed.

The Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL are also likely to get a Mint paint job. Google itself hinted at the Mint colour option by lately launching the Aqua variant of the Home Mini speaker. Separately, US accessory maker Spigen has listed a bunch of Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL cases. A recent report also pointed out that the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL will be available for pre-orders right after their October 9 launch event. Folks at Android Headlines have leaked a render showing the Pink colour option of the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL. The render details both new Pixel models from their front and back panels and shows the new paint job that covers not just the matte part of the back panel but also the glossy area that is available on the top of the rear side. Also, there is the power/ lock button in deeper Pink colour. The frontal panel, however, features a Black bezel frame - similar to what on the Black and White coloured Pixel 3 models. Roland Quandt of WinFuture tweeted late last month that the third colour option of the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL will be called ""Sand"". The Pink colour variant is, thus, likely to be officially dubbed Sand. Some previous rumours suggested that Google could also unveil a Mint colour variant of the new Pixel models. The search giant even hinted at the Mint colour option by launching the Home Mini in Aqua colour option. A teaser by the company also suggested the new colour option. Having said that, there aren't any renders or leaks supporting the speculation - though a batch showed a White Pixel 3 XL with Mint coloured buttons. Aside from the rumour around the new colour option, Spigen has listed cases of the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL. There are as many as 18 Spigen cases of the upcoming Pixel models that come in a variety of options such as Thin Fit 360, Tough Armor, Slim Armor, Armor Crystal, Rugged Armor, and Thin Fit. The company also has the Liquid Crystal case that could highlight the new colour options, including the Pink or Mint paint job. Furthermore, there are some thin options that are likely to support the Active Edge feature.  Photo Credit: Spigen   While most of the Spigen cases are available for purchase, there are some variants that are listed as ""coming soon."" We presume that all these cases will be available soon after the launch of the Pixel 3 models. The cases show single rear cameras and rear fingerprint sensors on both phones, and the presence of a display notch on the Pixel 3 XL. The Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL are expected to run Android 9.0 Pie out-of-the-box. In the new range, the Pixel 3 XL is rumoured to feature a 6.2-inch QHD+ (1440x2880 pixels) display option, while the Pixel 3 could come with a 5.5-inch display. The smartphones are also likely to come with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 SoC, along with Adreno 630 GPU and 4GB RAM. Both are also expected to have a dual selfie camera and a fingerprint sensor at the rear. "

According to global brand consultancy Interbrand's ""Best 100 Global Brands 2018"" report, Amazon achieved a 56 percent growth to become the third top brand globally. According to the ranking, Apple's brand value grew 16 percent (year-on-year) to $214.5 billion (roughly Rs. 15.8 lakh crores). It went on to become the first company in the US to hit the $1 trillion market cap (roughly Rs. 73.7 lakh crores). ""In second place, Google was up 10 percent to $155.5 billion while Amazon is valued at $100.8 billion,"" campaignlive.co.uk reported, citing the report findings. Microsoft (valued at $92.7 billion) was fourth while Coca Cola (valued at $66.3 billion) came fifth followed by Samsung on sixth spot. Facebook's brand value has declined 6 percent this year in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. ""A decade after the global financial crisis, the brands that are growing fastest are those that intuitively understand their customers and make brave iconic moves that delight and deliver in new ways,"" Charles Trevail, Global Chief Executive of Interbrand, was quoted as saying.

Amazon has announced that the OnePlus 6 will be available at a Rs. 5,000 discount during the Amazon Great Indian Festival starting October 10 - Amazon Prime members get access to these deals from 12pm IST (Noon) on October 9 itself.

Earlier this year, the company's mobile division CEO DJ Koh had announced that the much-anticipated handset may finally become a reality by November 2018. While leaks and speculations are still doing the rounds, we still don't know what it could look like. However, new details about the upcoming foldable phone have started to surface on the Internet. According to a new report, a leaked Galaxy S9 Android Pie build has tipped a few details about the upcoming handset. Additionally, the leaked firmware has also suggested the name for the successor to the Snapdragon 845 processor. First spotted by folks at XDA Developers, Samsung's foldable smartphone was referenced in the upcoming build for Android Pie for the Galaxy S9. They discovered a framework file that mentions 'winnerlte'. To recall, Samsung's foldable smartphone is rumoured to be codenamed 'Winner'. Interestingly, since Samsung generally uses a 'q' in the codenames to reference Snapdragon versions, it is expected that the foldable phone may be powered by an Exynos processor. As the configuration files for the upcoming smartphone were found in the unreleased Android Pie build, it is possible that the handset will ship with Android 9 out-of-the-box. The report predicts that the smartphone will use the Exynos 9810 SoC or Exynos 9820 SoC. Notably, the leaked Galaxy S9 Android Pie build also mentions four Galaxy S10 models. The leak does not reveal any more details about the foldable phone other than a ""_us"" suffix on the file's name that may or may not hint at a launch in the US. There is no clarity on whether the Galaxy 'Winner' will be released globally. Meanwhile, in the framework files, a policy file for an upcoming Qualcomm Snapdragon 8150 processor was also found. To recall, a report earlier this month had tipped that the Galaxy S10 series may sport the Snapdragon 8150 processor, an internal name for the Snapdragon 855 SoC. The report predicts that the policy file for the Snapdragon 8150 SoC could be for the Samsung Galaxy S10 series instead of the Galaxy F foldable smartphone. "

While the virtual assistant is primarily focused on voice, the tech giant says that nearly half of Google Assistant interactions utilise both voice and touch. With the latest makeover, Google wants Assistant to be easier to control ""whether you prefer to use your hands, your voice, or a combination of the two."" Besides that, Google has also announced support for digital goods and subscriptions, and Google Sign-In for the Assistant. With the Google Assistant redesign, now when you send a query, you will be able to interact with images, sliders, and buttons. Google, in a blog post, mentioned all the changes that have arrived as a part of the Google Assistant makeover. The voice assistant now comes with bigger visuals ""that are easy to glance quickly."" It will showcase new controls and sliders that will help users in managing their smart home devices. For instance, you can use dials to adjust your lights to the required brightness, or the sliders to control the volume of your smart speaker. Apart from the aesthetic upgrades in Google Assistant, there are some functional ones as well. The Google Assistant brings an interactive messaging interface, with which people can use their fingers to add a comma, change a word, or make any other quick edits while composing messages.

As a result of the latest move, product vendors will start using generic names instead of using 802.11ac or 802.11 a/b/g/n to highlight the Wi-Fi technology supported by their devices. The new naming system is retroactively implemented on all the Wi-Fi technology versions that have been launched so far, starting with the 802.11b that was launched in 1999, and going up to 802.11ac that was introduced in 2014. This means 802.11b will be represented as Wi-Fi 1, while 802.11ac will be called Wi-Fi 5. Similarly, the Wi-Fi Alliance has announced that the next-generation Wi-Fi technology that was so far known as 802.11ax will now be dubbed Wi-Fi 6. As each new generation of Wi-Fi standard brings advancements in terms of faster speeds, increased throughput, and better experiences over the previous generation, the new terminology will help users better understand the improvements in the new generations. The new numerical sequence includes Wi-Fi 6 for 802.11ax, Wi-Fi 5 for 802.11ac, Wi-Fi 4 for 802.11n, Wi-Fi 3 for 802.11g, Wi-Fi 2 for 802.11a, and Wi-Fi 1 for 802.11b. This somewhat looks clearer and more obvious than the previous naming scheme as it depicts newer Wi-Fi technologies with a larger numeric value. However, wider adoption of the new update is likely to take some time. Alongside working closely with product vendors to adopt the new naming scheme, the Wi-Fi Alliance is set to use a generational Wi-Fi name in its certification programmes based on major IEEE 802.11 releases beginning with Wi-Fi 6 to push the fresh adoption. Wi-Fi Certified 6 certification will be released next year for the hardware using Wi-Fi 6 technology. Further, device manufacturers and OS vendors will incorporate the generational terminology in user interface visuals to indicate the current type of Wi-Fi connection. This means if your phone or PC is connected to 802.11ac, it will show you Wi-Fi 5 branding instead of showing the simple Wi-Fi icon. This could even encourage end users to start using hardware with newer Wi-Fi technologies. ""For nearly two decades, Wi-Fi users have had to sort through technical naming conventions to determine if their devices support the latest Wi-Fi,"" said Edgar Figueroa, President and CEO of Wi-Fi Alliance, in a press statement. ""Wi-Fi Alliance is excited to introduce Wi-Fi 6, and present a new naming scheme to help industry and Wi-Fi users easily understand the Wi-Fi generation supported by their device or connection."" The Wi-Fi Alliance already has all the major tech companies on board. Also, companies including Broadcom, Intel, MediaTek, Netgear, and Qualcomm among various others have welcomed the new move. This will help with easy adoption of the new naming scheme. However, Kevin Robinson, the Alliance's marketing chief told The Verge that the new change will not be immediately adopted universally. Robinson also revealed that the industry conversation around the new change has been ""very transparent"" and the members are discussing the transition with each other. Among other companies on board, Netgear is already set to deploy the new branding. ""We believe that this will help customers better understand and appreciate the generational differences in Wi-Fi technology and usher in the latest 802.11ax standard,"" said David Henry, Senior Vice President of Connected Home Products, Netgear, in a statement. This suggests that the next-generation routers from Netgear could be amongst the first to come with the new naming scheme. "
GADGETS,"iPhone XS Max Ranked Behind Huawei P20 Pro, But Beats Samsung Galaxy Note 9 in DxOMark Camera Ranking",10/04/18,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/apple-iphone-xs-max-dxomark-camera-ranking-1926581,"DxOMark testers have found the iPhone XS Max an ""excellent all around"" in bright light Apple brought the iPhone XS Max with improved optics over what the last year's iPhone X offered. But despite the upgraded dual camera setup at the back, the iPhone XS Max hasn't emerged as the best camera smartphone if we look at the results published by camera testing portal DxOMark. According to the review by the DxOMark team, the latest iPhone model has received an overall score of 105, which is higher than the overall score of 103 achieved by the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 but lower than the Huawei P20 Pro that received an accumulated score of 109. DxOMark highlights that the software and image processing of the iPhone XS Max has ""obvious improvements"". The Cupertino giant has also offered features such as a Smart HDR and an Advanced Bokeh Depth to enhance imaging results, without any edits. As per the results published by DxOMark, the iPhone XS Max has received an overall score of 105 along with a photo score of 110. The video recording capabilities of the iPhone XS Max, on the other hand, have got a score of 96. Notably, DxOMark's top-ranked Huawei P20 Pro, which debuted with a triple camera setup earlier this year, got a photo score 114 and video score of 98. The Galaxy Note 9 also recently passed through the DxOMark benchmarks and received a photo score of 107 and video score of 94. Last year's iPhone X, which was at the sixth place on the board of DxOMark rating — after the Huawei P20 Pro, HTC U12+, Huawei P20, Samsung Galaxy S9+, and Google Pixel 2, received 101 and 89 photo and video scores, respectively. The testers at DxOMark Image Labs were ""pleased by the still image quality"" of the iPhone XS Max that is found to be ""excellent all around"" in bright light. The team specified that the exposure in outdoor images tends to be spot on with high levels of detail and pleasant colours. However, the zoom performance of the latest iPhone model is found to have some lags. The DxOMark team says that while zoom on the iPhone XS Max has been ""slightly improved"" from the iPhone X, the handset has ""course luminance noise"" and less detail in zoom shots when compared to competitors such as the Huawei P20 Pro and the Galaxy Note 9. The new iPhone is also found to deliver underexposure flash images and noticeable luminance noise in lower light and in the shadow areas of high-contrast images. Having said that, the DxOMark team has found that the dynamic range on the iPhone XS Max has been improved noticeably over the iPhone X. It is also worth noting here that while the Huawei P20 Pro captures more highlight detail, it is claimed to render a flatter image overall with less contrast when comparing with the iPhone XS Max. ""The iPhone XS Max captures noticeably better highlight detail in the bright background than last year's iPhone X. The current leader in the DxOMark ranking, the Huawei P20 Pro, captures a similarly wide dynamic range,"" the team wrote in its detailed review. Results were also pleasing under a high-contrast environment and colour rendering of the two sensors available on the iPhone XS Max is also pointed out to be ""fairly vibrant"" when shooting outdoors in bright light or in typical indoor light conditions. However, some desaturation was noticed in low light. A slightly yellow cast when shooting outdoors in bright light or under an artificial indoor light was also observed, but it is found to be within acceptable limits. The autofocus system of the iPhone XS Max has achieved a score of 100 points by the DxOMark team thanks to its fast speed and high accuracy level irrespective of lighting conditions. Artifacts are also found to be under control with the iPhone XS Max camera, though some colour flares surface occasionally in images captured with a strong light source inside or close to the edge of the frame. Further, the flash performance of the iPhone XS Max despite featuring a quad-LED flash isn't one its strong points. The handset resulted in underexposed shots when using the flash. Similarly, some colour quantisation and noticeable red-eye effect were spotted by the DxOMark team. Bokeh simulation on the iPhone XS Max is found be one of the best in the business with improved segmentation of subject and background over the iPhone X. There is also better detail in bokeh images than rivals such as the Huawei P20 Pro. On the video part, the iPhone XS Max is noted to have an ""outstanding performance in bright light conditions"" and wide dynamic range, vivid colours, accurate white balance, and high levels of detail. The image stabilisation system of the new iPhone is found to work ""very efficiently"" along with a fast and accurate autofocus. Some lag can be noticed in lower light videos and typical indoor lighting conditions, though. The dual rear camera setup of the iPhone XS includes a 12-megapixel wide-angle sensor along with an f/1.8 aperture and a 12-megapixel telephoto secondary sensor along with an f/2.4 aperture. The rear camera setup has a six-element lens on top that supports 2x optical zoom. There is also an improved TrueTone quad-LED flash. It should be pointed out that the DxOMark team captures and evaluates over 1,500 test images and more than two hours of video in controlled lab environments and natural indoor and outdoor scenes, using the default settings of the camera.   "

GADGETS,"Sharp Makes Long-Awaited OLED Foray, Wary of Big Spending",10/03/18,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/sharp-makes-long-awaited-oled-foray-wary-of-big-spending-1926277,"Japan's Sharp Corp unveiled its long-awaited move into the organic light-emitting diode (OLED) market on Wednesday as the Apple supplier looks to catch rival Samsung Electronics Co. Sharp will offer OLED panels in its new smartphones later this year and plans to sell the screens to other manufacturers, although it has signalled it is wary about a rapid expansion in OLED as momentum for the thinner but more expensive screens slows. The move comes as the Osaka-based electronics maker, a major supplier of iPhone liquid crystal display (LCD) screens, continues its recovery after being bought two years ago by Taiwan's Foxconn. Sharp's OLED smartphones will initially go on sale in Japan, by far its major market after it slashed its overseas smartphone business. The company has not yet reached any deals for sales to other smartphone makers, a spokeswoman said at a launch function in Tokyo. Sharp has so far invested JPY 57.4 billion ($505 million) to produce OLED panels in western Japan, less than a third of the planned 200 billion yen investment that was announced by Foxconn at the time of its acquisition in 2016. Sharp executives have said a shift from conventional LCD screens to more flexible OLED screens has been slower than expected due to high prices, making the firm cautious about aggressive OLED capacity expansion in the near term. ""The momentum for OLED panels is waning compared to a year ago and is unlikely to pick up immediately,"" senior Sharp executive Katsuaki Nomura told reporters in July. The slower acceptance of pricier OLED panels has also offered some relief to Japan Display Inc, another iPhone LCD screen supplier lagging behind Samsung and LG Display in OLED technology. Japan Display has said it may push back the start of OLED commercial production, currently scheduled for 2019, while seeking a partner to help finance the launch of a mass production line. Analysts say it typically costs more than JPY 200 billion ($1.8 billion) to start a mass production line. ""To our surprise, our clients are not moving away from LCD panels,"" Chief Financial Officer Takanobu Oshima said in August. South Korea's Electronic Times reported earlier this year that Apple has decided to use OLED screens in all three new iPhone models planned for next year, compared to two OLED models this year. But industry sources have told Reuters that Apple would not entirely abandon low-cost LCD screens at least for next year. Still, analysts say the OLED panel market could pick up again if improvements in production efficiency at Korean and Chinese panel makers lead to lower costs. OLED panels offer richer colours than LCDs and allow for foldable phones.   "

The feature was introduced by HTC as an Edge Sense to enable different operations by squeezing the sides of the smartphone. Google leveraged its partnership with the Taiwanese company to bring the Active Edge feature on the Pixel 2 models last year. Alongside the fresh teaser, Google has unveiled an Aqua colour variant of the Home Mini. The new colour option comes as a ""minty blue colour"". The Pixel 3 models could also come in an Aqua colour option. Google has additionally posted an image through the Made by Google account on Instagram that mocks the rumours around the ""Pixel Ultra"" model with a ""mini Pixel"" model that was lately expected to debut alongside the new Pixel models on October 9. The video posted by the Google Japan channel on YouTube teases the availability of the Active Edge feature on the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL. The feature that was a part of the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL was originally a part of the HTC U11. It allowed the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL users to trigger Google Assistant by squeezing the phone. Aside from teasing the Active Edge feature, the video teaser briefly suggests that the new Pixel models will come in Black, Blue, Green, Pink, and White colour options, as noted by 9to5Google. Google could also expand the usability of the Active Edge feature by adding third-party app support for squeezing gestures this time.   In addition to the teaser video posted on YouTube, Google has announced the Aqua colour of the Home Mini. This new colour option sits alongside the Chalk (White), Charcoal (Dark Gray), and Coral (Red/ Pink). The Google Home Mini with the all-new colour option will go on sale in the US from the Google Store and Walmart later this month. It is worth noting here that the Pixel 3 models are also speculated to come with the new Aqua colour option. Of course, the announcement of the new Google Home Mini variant ahead of the October 9 event puts more weight to the speculation.  Google Home Mini in Aqua colour option   Lastly, the Made by Google on Instagram has shared the design mockups of a ""tiny phone"" that is pointing at the Pixel Ultra, which was speculated to come as the new notch-less Pixel phone. The search giant is referring to the Pixel Ultra as ""mini Pixel"". ""We've heard rumours of a mini Pixel. Which begs the question how 'mini' is too mini? We have a feeling the next one will be a bit bigger than this. Tune in on 10/9 to see for yourself,"" the company said in the Instagram post.  Photo Credit: Instagram/ Made by Google   If we believe the rumours, the Pixel 3 family will come in 6.2-inch QHD+ (1440x2880 pixels) and a 5.5-inch display size options. The Pixel 3 XL, in the lineup, is expected to have a display notch, while the Pixel 3 is so far found to have a notch-less design. The new smartphones are also rumoured to come with improved cameras and have a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 SoC under the hood, along with an Adreno 630 GPU and 4GB of RAM. Both smartphones are expected to run Android 9.0 Pie out-of-the-box. A recent listing by China's JD.com has suggested that the Pixel 3 will come with a price tag of CNY 4,999 (roughly Rs. 52,800), while the price of the Pixel 3 XL is yet to be revealed. "
GADGETS,OnePlus 6T In-Display Fingerprint Sensor Detailed by CEO Pete Lau Ahead of Launch,10/03/18,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/oneplus-6t-screen-unlock-pete-lau-optical-fingerprint-sensor-1926266,"OnePlus 6T will not sport a headphone jack, and won't support fast charging. OnePlus 6T is confirmed to sport an in-display fingerprint sensor, and now CEO Pete Lau has detailed the efforts the company had to undergo before introducing it on the OnePlus 6T, and the technicalities of the new sensor. Apparently, the optical sensor was in the research lab for over a year, and was first expected to be introduced on the OnePlus 5T. But, because the tech did not meet OnePlus' standards back then, the company decided against it. Lau has also confirmed that the OnePlus 6T will not support fast charging or be IP certified. In the blog post, Lau reiterates the arrival of the in-display fingerprint scanner on the OnePlus 6T, and that the company is calling it Screen Unlock. The optical fingerprint module is attached to the back of the screen, and it ""houses a small lens that can accurately register the fingerprint as it presses down on the cover glass. The screen is used as a light source to enhance the outline of your fingerprint, enabling the sensor to accurately read its exact dimensions and shape."" Qualcomm's Trust Zone found on the Snapdragon 845 SoC is used to store the fingerprint information, and ascertain authenticity every time Screen Unlock is used. Lau says that ""Screen Unlock marks a momentous leap forward in unlock technology, delivering unmatched speed and convenience."" However, he does not detail on time taken to unlock the phone, but vaguely claims that it is ""incredibly fast."" He notes that the first generation optical module scheduled to be integrated on the OnePlus 5T was abandoned because it was very large in size, thereby struggling to hit a consistently high recognition rate. ""We attempted to compensate for the unreliable module through intelligent software optimizations. But, after numerous tests, we concluded our in-display fingerprint sensor wasn't ready to deliver the speed and reliability our users deserved,"" he explains on his blog post. The OnePlus 6T is expected to launch on October 17, and leaked renders suggest a vertical dual camera setup, as well as a waterdrop-shaped notch. Lau has also previously confirmed that the OnePlus 6T will not sport a headphone jack. It is tipped to sport a 6.4-inch Optic AMOLED full-HD+ display and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 SoC, coupled with 6GB and 8GB RAM options and up to 256GB of onboard storage. The smartphone is also reported to have a 3,700mAh battery that will be larger in capacity over the 3,300mAh battery available on the OnePlus 6. Moreover, the OnePlus 6T is expected to run Android 9.0 Pie out-of-the-box. "

GADGETS,"Xiaomi Mi A1 Allegedly Explodes While Charging, Mi A2 'Fingerprint Sensor Bug' Said to Impact Battery Life",10/03/18,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/xiaomi-mi-a1-explode-mi-a2-fingerprint-sensor-bug-impacting-battery-life-1926243,"Photo Credit: MIUI Forums/ Nexsad Xiaomi has marked the fingerprint sensor bug with a ""need more information"" tag on its MIUI forums Xiaomi Mi A1, the company's first Android One smartphone, is now in reports for having allegedly exploded while it was being charged. The owner of the affected handset was reportedly jolted out of his sleep when the Mi A1 exploded. In addition to the Mi A1, Xiaomi is facing outrage for a reported fingerprint sensor bug within the Mi A2, the successor to the Mi A1, that brings a sudden battery death issue. Both Android One models by the Beijing-based company are currently anticipated to receive an update to Android 9.0 Pie. Unlike other Xiaomi smartphones that have MIUI on top of Android, the Mi A-Series models run stock Android out-of-the-box. As posted in an MIUI forum post, a Xiaomi Mi A1 exploded while it was being charged overnight. The owner of the affected phone often put it on charging overnight. But one day, it is said that he was jolted out of his sleep after hearing an explosion from his phone. He ignored the blow and went back to sleep, but in the morning, he found the Mi A1 in an ""extremely [damaged] condition."" It is unclear whether the user was charging the affected Mi A1 using a genuine charger. Also, the MIUI forum post says that the user reached the customer care. The damaged Mi A1 unit is claimed to be eight months old and used with a protective case. Importantly, this was the first such case reported for the Mi A1. Alongside the alleged explosion of the Mi A1, Xiaomi has come in the headlines for a Mi A2 bug that is impacting its battery life. Several users on the Linus Tech Tips forums have reported that the fingerprint sensor of the Mi A2 is using all the eight cores of the Snapdragon 660 SoC at maximum speed. This results in the sudden death of the battery and reduces the screen-on time to three or four hours. Xiaomi hasn't revealed any details around the bug, but on its MIUI forums, it has marked the bug as ""need more information"", as spotted by Android Authority. The user reports suggest that the problem exists on a large number of Mi A2 units for over last one month. However, the company has neither pushed any bug fix nor acknowledged any issue. We've reached out to Xiaomi for clarity on the alleged Mi A1 explosion as well as the reported Mi A2 battery issue and will update this space accordingly. "

A new report has surfaced that suggests the Nokia 7.1, successor to last year’s Nokia 7, might make an appearance soon. The smartphone has been leaked with alleged press renders that make it look like a compact Nokia 7.1 Plus with the same display notch and substantial bottom chin. Leaked with model number TA-1100, the Nokia 7.1 renders come to us courtesy veteran tipster Roland Quandt from WinFuture. The smartphone is shown with a Nokia 7.1 Plus-like display notch and a bottom chin with Nokia branding on the front.

Lau, in a previous interview, had already confirmed that the upcoming flagship will not come with a headphone jack. However, he has now revealed the exact reason for discontinuing the feature. However, apart from that, he has confirmed that two more features will be missing from the OnePlus 6T - wireless charging support and IP rating. While the expected launch of the smartphone is still a few days away, we now know that it will not come with some of the key features that are present in most premium handsets. In an interview with CNET, OnePlus CEO Pete Lau suggested that OnePlus 6T will be more expensive than its previous variant. He did not reveal the exact price of the upcoming smartphone, but said that the inclusion of an in-display fingerprint sensor is one of the key reasons for the price rise. Of course, seeing the previous launches by the company, OnePlus will be following its own trending of higher pricing for each newer model. Lau was quoted as saying, ""Screen Unlock technology is something very new and there's a definite cost required for that new technology. It's not cheap."" He also noted that the new feature is also the reason for a missing headphone jack and that the smartphone is 0.45mm thicker than the OnePlus 6. Additionally, Lau has also revealed that the OnePlus 6T will not have wireless charging support. He said that OnePlus wants the wireless charging technology to be as fast as its Dash Charging tech. If the feature os introduced in its current form, it would mean the OnePlus 6T will have to be thicker and will conduct a lot of heat. Lau was quoted as saying, ""We're working hard on this. When we get to the day that the wireless charging can get up to speed without the implication of heat that we expect, then I believe we can integrate the technology."" Finally, the OnePlus CEO noted that there is no IP rating in the OnePlus 6T. He said that OnePlus 6T is more water-resistant than any of its predecessors and can survive a drop in the sink or a splash during a rainstorm. Because of the cost of obtaining an official IP rating, OnePlus has skipped the official rating entirely. He is quoted to say that the feature is ""unreasonable"" as ""the number of users that are taking their phone to go swimming are few and far between."" "

GADGETS,"Samsung Q3 Profit Seen at Record, but Peaking, as Chips Shine",10/03/18,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/samsung-q3-profit-seen-at-record-but-peaking-as-chips-shine-1925976,"Samsung Electronics Co is set to post a hefty jump in third-quarter profit to record levels after its chip unit put in a sterling performance on demand from data centres and improved production yields. The July-September quarter is, however, expected to mark a peak in earnings as a two-year super cycle of tight supply and soaring demand comes to an end, with prices of some types of chips already sliding sharply. The world's top memory chipmaker, due to report preliminary results on October 5, is forecast to book an 18 percent surge in operating profit to KRW 17.2 trillion ($15.5 billion), a Refinitiv poll of 15 analysts showed. Revenue is seen climbing 3.7 percent. That handily beats operating profit growth of 6 percent in the previous quarter when its Galaxy S9 device missed sales targets and competition from cheaper Chinese-made phones ate into margins for its mobile business. The big boon for Samsung has been a spike in prices for DRAM chips, which help devices perform multiple tasks at once and are its main memory product. DRAMeXchange estimates the average price of server DRAM rose 14 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, as companies build data centres for cloud computing. But prices for NAND chips, used for longer-term data storage, more than halved in the same period as supply swamped demand. Those drops are expected to accelerate, while most analysts also predict DRAM prices will begin to decline. ""Starting in the fourth quarter, I expect DRAM prices to fall by around 10 percent. That will hurt Samsung's operating margin,"" said Eo Kyu-jin, an analyst at eBest Investment & Securities. While Samsung is forecast to still book decent operating profit growth of 12 percent in the fourth quarter, analysts predict minimal profit growth in the first half of 2019 followed by profit declines, albeit small ones, in the second half, Refinitiv data showed. Even so, Samsung is expected to weather drops in DRAM chip prices better than rivals due to gains in production technology that allow it make smaller and faster chips per silicon wafer. ""Even though the average selling price will decline next year, Samsung's memory chip business will still have solid profits due to cost-saving measures,"" said Avril Wu, senior research director at DRAMeXchange. While its chip unit accounts for nearly 80 percent of operating profit, Samsung will also benefit from a rebound in prices for large displays, as well as increased orders for organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays after Apple launched new iPhones. Samsung's display unit is expected to post about KRW 812 billion ($730 million) in quarterly operating profit, down 19 percent from a year earlier but more than five times the prior quarter. It will, however, have to deal with more competition next year as rivals from China and South Korea have started or plan to begin mass production of small-sized flexible OLED panels. Its mobile division will see operating profit drop for a third quarter in a row, hurt by sluggish demand for smartphones as the market matures. Marketing costs for its new Galaxy Note series also pressured mobile earnings, analysts said. © Thomson Reuters 2018 "

GADGETS,"OnePlus 6T Shown Alongside OnePlus 6 in New Teaser; Leaked Renders Show Waterdrop Notch, Glossy and Matte Finishes",10/03/18,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/oneplus-6t-teaser-waterdrop-notch-leaked-renders-ahead-of-launch-1925910,"Photo Credit: Twitter/ OnePlus The official teaser shows the OnePlus 6 on top of the OnePlus 6T. While the expected launch of the OnePlus 6T is still a few days away, a teaser image has been released that shows the upcoming handset alongside the existing OnePlus 6. The teaser highlights both smartphone models from a side - without detailing any major differences. However, it does show the change in the placement of the earpiece. The OnePlus 6 carries a traditional display notch with an earpiece at the centre, whereas the teaser shows the earpiece of the OnePlus 6T is available at the top edge. This once again suggests the presence of a waterdrop notch design, similar to what was featured on the Oppo R17. Separately, OnePlus 6T renders have surfaced that show the smartphone in both glossy and matte finishes. The leaked renders also highlight the waterdrop notch design. OnePlus has released a teaser image that shows the OnePlus 6T alongside the OnePlus 6. The OnePlus 6 available on the top shows its earpiece and the traditional notch design, whereas the OnePlus 6T is available on the bottom has the earpiece on the top edge. This hints at the presence of a waterdrop notch that we recently saw on the Oppo R17. Further, the left side of both OnePlus phones looks identical, with a dual-SIM tray and a unified volume rocker. We can easily speculate that there will be a power button and an alert slider at the right of the OnePlus 6T, similar to the OnePlus 6. The size and thickness of the OnePlus 6T and OnePlus 6 also look quite similar - though the former is expected to have a slightly larger display than the latter. Coming towards the leaked renders, courtesy WinFuture.de, there are glossy and matte black versions of the OnePlus 6T - similar to the OnePlus 6. These could be the Mirror Black and Midnight Black versions. The renders also show the waterdrop notch and even thinner bezels over the previous OnePlus flagship. The front panel looks similar to the Oppo R17. The notch includes the front-facing camera sensor, whereas the earpiece is available on the side of the top edge. On the back, there is a vertically placed dual camera setup along with an LED flash module and OnePlus branding. The optical fingerprint sensor that was featured at the back of the OnePlus 6 is missing from the leaked renders of OnePlus 6T. This makes sense as OnePlus has already confirmed that there will be an in-display fingerprint sensor on its next flagship model. The confirmed absence of the 3.5mm headphone jack can also be seen from the leaked renders.  OnePlus 6T render showing its glossy finish versionPhoto Credit: WinFuture.de   Overall, the design of the OnePlus 6T surfaced in the leaked renders looks quite similar to the Oppo R17. OnePlus and Oppo notably share the same parent company, BBK Electronics. Thus, both vendors have often been spotted using similar hardware, albeit with major differences on the software side. To recall, some recent rumours have claimed that the OnePlus 6T will come with a 6.4-inch Optic AMOLED full-HD+ display and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 SoC, coupled with 6GB and 8GB RAM options and up to 256GB of onboard storage. The smartphone is also reported to have a 3,700mAh battery that will be larger in capacity over the 3,300mAh battery available on the OnePlus 6. Moreover, the OnePlus 6T is expected to run Android 9.0 Pie out-of-the-box. If we believe a recently leaked invite, the OnePlus 6T launch is scheduled for October 17. The Chinese company hasn't revealed the formal launch date, though. "

GADGETS,iPhone XS Charging Issues Reported by Some Users; Older Models Also Seem Impacted,10/01/18,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/iphone-xs-max-charging-issues-lightning-post-ios-12-older-iphones-1924850,"Photo Credit: YouTube/ Unbox Therapy Dozens of users are having charging issues with different configurations and colours of the iPhone XS Max The iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max were showcased to the world in mid-September, and later went on sale in certain markets by the end of last month. Now that millions of Apple fans around the world have their hands on the latest and greatest from Apple, issues are being reported by some users, as everyone gets familiar with their units. The most recent development states that some of the new phones are not charging automatically even when plugged into a power source, and require some sort of manual input from the user to initiate charging. Let’s get into the details of a potential iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max ‘charge-gate’. It all started with a post on Apple’s Communities portal on September 24, when a user claimed a Lightning port charging issue with his newly bought iPhone XS Max. “I connect the Lightning cable to my phone to charge and most of the time it’s automatically charges. However I’ve noticed several times plugging the phone in and no charge comes up. Tried unplugging and plugging back in, sometimes it’ll work [sic].” He goes on to mention that keeping the unit untouched doesn’t work and he has to illuminate the screen for the charging icon to pop up. Having used only Apple-branded cables to charge the phone, he believes that this could either be a port issue or something related to software. There seemed to be no charging issues with the iPhone XS Max variant we tested, which was with the Apple-branded 12W charger. Ever since the post last week, dozens of users have commented with similar issues mostly regarding different configurations and colour variants of the iPhone XS Max. However, heading over to Reddit, where a similar thread was created over the weekend, the picture seems to change a bit. “My iPhone X did this also, so it’s not just the iPhone XS. I chalked it up to their USB security updates,” mentions a user. Following that are few comments about these issues popping up on older iPhones like the iPhone 6s and iPhone 7 Plus. 9to5Mac adds that some users report issues on iPad models as well, apart from the iPhone XS. The post has since been picked up by popular YouTuber Unbox Therapy who performed his own test to verify the issue. What his findings reveal is that while the iPhone X and iPhone XS respond normally to the Lightning cable, the iPhone XS Max only displays the charging icon when tapped to wake. Apple has not responded to the ‘charge-gate’ issue yet, but this could certainly be linked to the latest iOS 12 update. If that is indeed the case, a simple software update might be the solution for this issue. "

Leaked thanks to a TENAA listing, the new variant has 10GB of RAM, 256GB of inbuilt storage, and a 3,645mAh battery. The remaining specifications seem identical to the standard Find X model, which was launched in India at Rs. 59,990. In other news from China, Lenovo has announced it will launch the Z5 Pro smartphone on October 1 in the country. The smartphone has a slider mechanism for the camera, similar to the one we have previously seen on the Oppo Find X, but works without a motor. There are no other details about the Lenovo Z5 Pro at the moment. The Nokia 7 Plus Android 9.0 Pie update is rolling out now, but all eyes are on its successor, the Nokia 7.1 Plus. The upcoming HMD Global event being held on October 4 is expected to mark the unveiling of the next-generation smartphone. To nobody’s surprise, all the key Nokia 7.1 Plus specifications have leaked online already owing to a TENAA listing.

Leaked renders and alleged live images showing its design have also cropped up on the internet the past week. Flipkart and Amazon have announced the dates of the respective festive season sales they will be hosting this month. The Flipkart Big Billion Days sale will be held from October 10 to October 14, with Flipkart Plus members getting access 3 hours ahead of the other customers. Unlike previous sales, the e-commerce brand has not previewed major deals from the upcoming sale and has only announced that buyers will get up to 80 percent discount on electronics and up to 90 percent off on home decor, fashion, and personal care products. HDFC Bank debit and credit card users will get 10 percent instant discount, though minimum cart value and maximum discount are not yet known.

Prime members will get early access to deals, and SBI credit and debit card users will receive 10 percent instant discount, and Amazon Pay users will get cashback of up to Rs. 300. No deals have been previewed by Amazon either. How Flipkart and Amazon Are Making It Easier to Pay for Your Festive Season Shopping Separately, Amazon India has announced the launch of Prime Reading, a service that provides users access to a bunch of free books. It will coexist with the subscription-based Kindle Unlimited service. However, while Kindle Unlimited lets users read thousands of books with a fixed fee, the Prime Reading catalogue only consists of a few hundred books. The titles will be available in English, Hindi, Marathi, and Tamil. To access the service, users only need to login to the Kindle app on the their phone, tablet of Kindle e-book reader, and look for titles marked ‘Prime Reading’. Facebook, which is already struggling in maintaining its users’ trust due to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, has announced that it suffered a massive breach that affects as many as 50 million of its users. The breach occurred as hackers exploited three security flaws to steal access tokens that allow users to login to the service automatically. Mark Zuckerberg said the company is not aware if any accounts were “actually misused.” However, no passwords were leaked as part of this hack, only access tokens. As a security measure, Facebook has logged out the 50 million affected users from their accounts on various devices.   WhatsApp too was in the news this week as its co-founder Brian Acton spoke about why he left Facebook — and about $850 million (about Rs. 6,160 crores) on the table. In an interview with Forbes, Acton revealed how he clashed with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg as well as COO Sheryl Sandberg over monetising WhatsApp and how the app’s encrypted messages stood in the way of the social media company harvesting user data. Of course, ads are coming to the app, with a new report claiming ads for WhatsApp for iPhone being under development. In other news, WhatsApp has partnered with Reliance Jio to tackle the fake news menace, with all new Jio Phone users receiving educational material to tell them about spotting a forwarded message and encourages them to share messages thoughtfully. Moving on to the telecom sector, Jio’s rivals are hard at work in their attempts to take back market share from the operator with the help of low-cost recharges. Vodafone Idea Limited announced as many as six recharges priced between Rs. 24 and Rs. 245, and reportedly applicable in UP West, Tamil Nadu, Chennai, and Punjab circles. The Rs. 25 recharge offers offers talk-time of Rs. 18 and 10MB of data for 28 days, the Rs. 35 pack gives talk-time worth Rs. 26 and 100MB of data for 28 days. The Rs. 65 recharge comes with talk-time of Rs. 65 and 200MB data for a validity period of 28 days. Then there’s the Rs. 95 Vodafone recharge with Rs. 95 talk-time and 500MB mobile data for 28-day validity. The local, STD, and landline call rates for Tamil Nadu and Punjab is 30 paise per minute and for UP (West) region, it costs 1 paisa per 2 seconds. The local, STD and landline call rates for UP (West) and Punjab is 1 paisa per second and for Tamil Nadu, it is 60 paise per minute. The Rs. 145 Vodafone recharge provides users with talk-time of Rs. 145 and 1GB data for 42 days. Lastly, the Rs. 245 plan provides Rs. 245 worth of talk-time and 2GB data for a validity period of 84 days. Local, STD and landline call rate for Tamil Nadu and Punjab is 30 paise per minute, while for UP (West) it is 1 paisa per 2 seconds. Not to be outdone, Airtel launched six recharges for its prepaid users priced at Rs. 25, Rs. 35, Rs. 65, Rs. 95, Rs. 145, and Rs. 245 in the same circles. The Rs. 25 Airtel recharge offers Rs. 18.69 talk time and 10MB data, and 28-day validity, while the Rs. 35 pack gives Rs. 26.6 talk time and 100MB data, both with validity of 28 days; the latter also discount calls to 60 paise per minute. The Rs. 65 recharge gives talk time of Rs. 65, 200MB data, and calls at tariff of 60 paise per minute for 28 days. The Rs. 95 Airtel recharge provides Rs. 95 talk time, 500MB data, and voice calls at 30 paise per minute for 28 days. Similar to its corresponding Vodafone recharge, the Airtel Rs. 145 recharge gives full talk time, 1GB data, and calling at 30 paise per minute for 28 days. Finally there’s the Rs. 245 pack that offers full talk time, 2GB of data, and calls at discounted rate of 30 paise per minute for 84-day validity. BSNL marked 18 years of its founding this week with a new Rs. 18 recharge that provides users with unlimited data and calls for two days. This promotional offer also provides 18 percent additional data on select high-value recharges. With this, the 601 BSNL recharge will now have talk-time of Rs. 709 and bundled data will be 5GB. Similarly, the Rs. 1,801 recharge will give subscribers talk-time of Rs. 2,125 and 15GB of data, and the Rs. 1,201 recharge will provide Rs. 1,417 as the talk-time and data capped at 10GB. These additional talk-time and data benefits will be available only on recharges purchased between October 1 and October 18 on pan-India basis.

As other over-the-air (OTA) updates by the Chinese company, the new software version has arrived as an ""incremental roll-out"" that will initially reach a small number of OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T users — with a broader rollout set for the coming days. The fresh update comes months after the Chinese company released the OxygenOS 5.0.4 for the OnePlus 3-series models with the July Android security patch and an improved selfie experience. The company also recently brought the OxygenOS 5.0.5 with some general bug fixes and improvements. As per the official changelog posted by the OnePlus team in a forum post, the OxygenOS 5.0.6 update for the OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T comes with the September Android security patch.

The update notably patches vulnerabilities ranging from high to critical. In addition to the September Android security patch, the latest OxygenOS update for the OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T brings general fixes and performance improvements. ""For those who were on previous versions for OnePlus 3 and 3T, we appreciate your active feedback and attempts to reach out to us. With your help, we have been able to better optimise and improve several key areas,"" the company wrote in the forum post.

GADGETS,US Judge Rules Against Qualcomm's Appeal to Ban iPhone Imports in US,09/29/18,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/us-judge-rules-against-qualcomm-appeal-to-ban-iphone-imports-in-us-1924301,"A US trade judge on Friday declined to block the importation of Apple iPhones with chips from Intel Corp, handing a major defeat to Qualcomm Inc in its high-stakes legal dispute with the iPhone maker. A US International Trade Commission judge said Apple's phones infringed one Qualcomm patent related to power management technology, but denied the chipmaker's request for a ban on the import of some iPhones into the United States. Thomas Pender, an administrative law judge at the ITC, said that ""public interest factors"" weighed against granting Qualcomm's request for a ban. The determination will be reviewed by other judges. Qualcomm, the world’s largest mobile phone chipmaker, has another pending patent case against Apple before the ITC. Apple said in a statement that Qualcomm had unfairly demanded royalties for technologies it had nothing to do with. ""We’re glad the ITC stopped Qualcomm’s attempt to damage competition and ultimately harm innovators and US consumers,” Apple said. In a statement, Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg said the company was pleased the judge did find patent infringement, but ""it makes no sense to then allow infringement to continue by denying an import ban. That goes against the ITC mandate to protect American innovators by blocking the import of infringing products,” Rosenberg said. “There are many ways Apple could stop infringing our technology without affecting the public interest."" Apple and Qualcomm are locked in a wide-ranging legal dispute in which Apple has accused Qualcomm of unfair patent licensing practices. Qualcomm has in turn accused Apple of patent infringement. San Diego, California-based Qualcomm initiated an ITC case against Apple in July 2017, alleging that iPhones containing Intel chips infringed six patents describing technology that helps smartphones perform well without draining the battery. Qualcomm did not allege that Intel chips violate its patents, but claimed that the way Apple implemented them in the iPhone does. In a blog post on Friday after the ITC decision, Intel's general counsel, Steven Rodgers, said Qualcomm had ""publicly disparaged Intel’s products"" as inferior to Qualcomm's during the case. ""It is easy to say things, but Intel’s track record is clear,"" Rodgers wrote in his post. ""Every day, we push the boundaries of computing and communication technologies. And, the proof is in the pudding: last year, the US Patent Office awarded more patents to Intel than to Qualcomm."" The ITC is a popular venue for patent disputes because it handles cases relatively quickly and can more easily bar an infringing product from the US market than federal courts can. Qualcomm dropped three of the six patents from the case before a trial that began in June. Pender said in Friday's decision that Apple infringed only one of the three patents remaining in the case. © Thomson Reuters 2018 "

This is, notably, not the first time Android Pie isn't a part of the Android distribution dashboard. The previous two revisions also showed the insignificant share of the Android version that was released last month and available across all Pixel smartphones and Essential Phone since launch. Companies such as HMD Global and OnePlus recently announced the rollout of Android Pie for their key models. Of course, Android Pie market share should expand over time as more devices adopt the new operating system. The fresh distribution numbers by Google show that Android Pie is yet to open an account due to having less than 0.1 percent of distribution so far. Models such as OnePlus 6 and Nokia 7 Plus lately started receiving the latest update. However, the latest version is yet to reach budget devices that are contributing largely to the Android market. Having said that, Android Nougat, which comprises Android 7.0 and 7.1, continues its domination with a share of 29.3 percent of the total Android market in September. This shows a slight dip from the 30.8 percent share reported earlier this month. Android Marshmallow comes as the second most popular Android release after Nougat with a share of 21.6 percent. This is again slightly lower than the previous 22.7 percent share. Android Oreo with version 8 and 8.1, on the other hand, jumped from 14.6 percent to 19.2 percent. Particularly, Android 8.0 captured 13.4 percent, up from 11.4 percent surfaced previously, whereas Android 8.1 reached 5.8 percent from the previous 3.2 percent. Apart from the popular Android Nougat, Marshmallow, and Oreo versions, the Android distribution chart shows Android Lollipop at 18.3 percent, KitKat at 7.8 percent, and Jelly Bean at 3.2 percent. Dated versions, including Android Ice Cream Sandwich and Gingerbread, are also a part of the distribution chart with 0.3 percent share each.  Updated Android Distribution ChartPhoto Credit: Google   Alongside the updated distribution numbers of different Android versions, Google has revealed the fresh data of OpenGL ES adoption. OpenGL 3.2 has continued to lead at 34.7 percent, while OpenGL 3.0 stood second with 30.1 percent share and OpenGL 2.0 came third with a 21.6 percent share. OpenGL 3.1, which is the predecessor of the latest OpenGL version, reached 13.6 percent. The latest distribution numbers from Google have been collected during a seven-day period ending on September 28. "

The two robberies at the Palo Alto Apple Store comes after last week's launch of the iPhone XS and super premium iPhone XS Max which attracted higher than average enthusiasts to Apple Stores through the weekend.    ""The defendants are charged with entering the stores in large groups wearing hoodies and snatching products on display,"" Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement on Friday. In some instances, the group was able to grab more than $20,000 (about Rs. 14.5 lakh) in merchandise. ""Seven adults were arrested on September 25 and booked in the Alameda County Jail. Another is in custody in Sonoma County. Arrest warrants have been issued for nine other suspects. The probe is on,"" Becerra added. Notably, burglaries at Apple Stores have become common over the past few years, with suspects taking incredibly quick approaches to swiping expensive products. Between late August and September, six Apple Stores in the region were reportedly robbed at least nine times.  On Sunday, an Apple Store in Santa Rosa area was also looted for the second time in less than a month, according to Fox News.

While Apple uses Google as the default search engine in Safari on iOS devices such as iPhones and iPads, the company also uses Bing in various other places such as searching the web via Siri.

GADGETS,"Nokia 9 Price Leaked; Alleged Live Images Show Five-Lens Setup, Curved Display",09/28/18,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/nokia-9-price-cny-4799-live-images-5-lens-setup-curved-display-1923898,"Photo Credit: Weibo The new leak shows the Nokia 9's frontal design that resembles the Nokia 8 Sirocco Nokia 9 has allegedly been outed in another round of leaks that show off live images as well as the pricing of the upcoming Nokia flagship that has been rumoured to be in the works for a long time. The new live images coincide with the ones leaked previously, with elements like an impressive five-lens camera setup at the back with Zeiss optics and an LED flash. Apart from that, the new Nokia 9 leak gives out the phone’s front design, which is reminiscent of the Nokia 8 Sirocco with its curved edges and gives the Nokia 9 a borderless look. Tipped to launch at MWC 2019 in Barcelona, the Nokia 9 probably has a long way to go until an official announcement. However, considering the fact that HMD Global hasn’t unveiled a “proper” Nokia flagship since the brand’s comeback at MWC 2017, all eyes are on each and every leak that surfaces around the Nokia 9. This new leak comes to us via Chinese social networking website Weibo where a user has posted back and front shots of the Nokia 9. As mentioned, the new leak reveals Nokia 9 price will start at CNY 4,799 (roughly Rs. 50,600). The penta-lens setup on the back of this leaked smartphone appears to be the most ambitious camera module ever seen on a handset. The report claims that the five-lens setup at the back consists of two 12-megapixel sensors with optical image stabilisation, two 16-megapixel sensors, and a fifth 8-megapixel sensor. On the front, it is claimed that the Nokia 9 will sport a 12-megapixel selfie camera. An in-display fingerprint sensor, and 6GB RAM are said to be part of the package, along with wireless charging support. The report claims the smartphone will come in two storage options, 64GB and 256GB. The phone in the leak bears model number TA-1094, consistent with previous spottings and rumours. Previous reports have suggested that the penta-lens setup is the reason behind a substantial delay in the Nokia 9’s production cycle. As for other specifications, the Nokia 9 is expected to sport the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 SoC, a 6.01-inch display. Before the five-camera setup leaks, the Nokia 9 was rumoured to sport a triple camera setup with a 41-megapixel, a 20-megapixel, and a 9.7-megapixel sensor at the back. The phone is expected to arrive in single SIM and dual SIM variants. "

Android Pie arrived first on Pixel handsets, including the original Pixel and Pixel XL as well as the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL. Early user feedback suggests that after updating to Android Pie, the ability to see the apps with blocked notifications has been removed. The issue was reported in August and it is now marked as fixed by Google, and the company even confirmed that the ability will be retained in a future update. The tech giant has marked this issue as fixed in Google Issue Tracker, and even said that the option to see list of apps with block notifications is coming back in a future update. Currently, after the Android 9 Pie update, the App Notifications menu gives the options to sort in 'Most recent' and Most frequent' lists, however there is no option to see the list of apps with blocked notifications. This was available prior to Android Pie, and was a neat way to discover these apps, and unblock the option for any app if the user so desired. It just made discovery easier, and users did miss the functionality on Android Pie. To elaborate, in Android Oreo, users could go to System Settings > Apps & notifications > Notifications > App Notifications, and tap on the blue All apps header. From there, users could pick Apps: Turned off to view apps with blocked notifications. In Android 9 Pie, heading to System Settings > Apps & notifications > Notifications > App Notifications, and tapping on the blue header, only shows Most Recent and Most frequent. There is no way to see a list of all apps with blocked notifications. While Google hasn't mentioned if the feature will come back in the next update itself or not, we presume that to be the case, given that the issue has been marked as fixed. "

Seoul prosecutors have accused Lee of involvement in a company-wide operation to dismantle a union at Samsung's after-service unit between 2013 and 2016 when he was chief finance officer. The indictment of Lee and other company officials on Thursday is another headache for the tech giant whose vice chairman Jay Y.

Lee Sang-hoon, who has led the board since March, is not related to the founding family. ""His status remains unchanged,"" a company spokeswoman said. Ra Doo-shik, who leads a union representing more than 1,000 workers at Samsung Electronics Service, said on Friday that the indictment was encouraging. ""We are hoping that upcoming court proceedings will reveal the true picture,"" Ra told Reuters. Jay Y.

Mid-range smartphones (roughly Rs 14,000-Rs 29,000), will grow 20 percent (year-on-year) in 2018 and by almost four times during the next five years to make it one of the most important smartphone segments in India, the market research firm added. The sales volume sweet spot is moving from sub-$150 (nearly Rs 10,000) segment towards mid-tier as many features and capabilities common among flagship models, progressively diffuse through to these lower price bands, noted Counterpoint's white paper on 'India Mid-Tier Smartphone Segment and Opportunity for SoC Players'. ""Features such as full-screen displays, dual-cameras, biometric security and support for Artificial Intelligence (AI) are beginning to make in-roads to the mid-range. They will become widespread over the next few years,"" said Tarun Pathak, Associate Director at Counterpoint Research. Many of these advanced features will be enabled and enhanced through the evolution of the underlying System-on-Chip (SoCs) and other components. ""These features will help OEMs to differentiate their offerings in the mid-tier segment at a time when overall smartphone innovation is perceived to have plateaued,"" Pathak added. India is the second largest smartphone market in the world after China. It has just surpassed 400 million smartphone users. However, this accounts for just 44 percent of the potential total addressable market for smartphones as the country is under-penetrated relative to many other markets. ""Part of this lack of development can be attributed to the poor relative development of data-capable mobile networks and high data pricing. Upstart operator, Reliance Jio, has catalysed a rapid shift toward 4G LTE, together with much more accessible data pricing,"" noted Research Director Neil Shah. Looking at the competitive environment, the top five brands contributed to 92 per cent share of the mid-tier segment in India. Samsung, Vivo, Apple, Oppo, and Huawei were the leading brands in the first half of 2018. ""However, we expect competition to increase in the segment as more brands enter including Xiaomi, Asus, Nokia HMD, and others,"" said the white paper. The role of SoC players is critical to unlocking the potential of the mid-tier market segments. If done successfully, we believe the mid-tier segments will grow almost four times in volume over the next five years in India. To enable this growth, cutting-edge solutions such as Qualcomm's Snapdragon 710 are required on a broad scale. ""Qualcomm already has a strong presence in key brands in the mid-tier. The Snapdragon 710 can further strengthen Qualcomm's share within key brands in the mid-tier segments as it has in the $100-$200 lower-tier segment,"" the white paper added. "
GADGETS,Oppo Find X Variant With 10GB RAM Listed on TENAA in China,09/28/18,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/oppo-find-x-10-gb-ram-variant-listed-tenaa-certification-china-1923651,"A new Oppo Find X variant has popped up on TENAA that comes with 10GB of RAM and 256GB of onboard storage The Oppo Find X’s upcoming high-end variant is all set to become the first smartphone in the world to feature 10GB of RAM. The phone is now in the process of mandatory certification in China, and will be likely be unveiled in the coming weeks. While the phone was first launched in June this year, and certified in May, a new variant has popped up on TENAA that comes with 10GB of RAM and 256GB of onboard storage. Launch date has not been confirmed by Oppo yet. This 10GB variant of the Oppo Find X is listed on Chinese certification website TENAA, first spotted by Twitter user Ice Universe in a tweet. It appears to have a smaller 3,645mAh battery unit, but there is no word on whether this variant will support regular VOOC or Super VOOC charging standards. Apart from that, specifications seem to match the existing models of the Find X. To recall, the Oppo Find X comes at a starting price of CNY 4,999 in China and goes all the way up to EUR 1,699 for the Limited Lamborghini Edition with 512GB storage. In India, the smartphone has been priced at Rs. 59,990 for the lone 8GB RAM/ 256GB inbuilt storage model. The Oppo Find X runs ColorOS 5.1 on top of Android 8.1 Oreo, and sports a 6.42-inch full-HD+ (1080x2340 pixels) AMOLED display panel with a 19.5:9 aspect ratio and 93.8 percent screen-to-body ratio. It is powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 SoC, paired with Adreno 630 GPU, 8GB of RAM, and up to 256GB of onboard storage. In terms of optics, the Find X bears a motorised camera slider with a dual rear camera setup. The rear module consists of a 16-megapixel primary sensor and a 20-megapixel secondary sensor. There is a single 25-megapixel camera sensor up front, with f/2.0 aperture, for selfies and video calling. The phone packs in a 3,730mAh battery under the hood with VOOC fast charging. It would be interesting to see how much of an upgrade the humongous amount of RAM offers over the 8GB RAM option. Apple and Android flagships like the Apple iPhone XS and Google Pixel 2 come with 4GB RAM each and perform exceedingly well. "
GADGETS,"Lenovo Z5 Pro Launch Set for October 1, Tipped to Sport Manual Camera Slider, Notch-Less Display",09/28/18,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/lenovo-z5-pro-october-1-launch-manual-camera-slider-1923641,"Photo Credit: Weibo Lenovo Z5 Pro to sport a true bezel-less display After making tall claims, Lenovo unveiled the Z5 smartphone in June with several promises unfulfilled, such as the fully bezel-less design. Running up to the launch of the Lenovo Z5, VP Chang Chen had released several teasers promising a notch-less display, a mammoth battery, and 4TB of storage as well. However, none of that was seen on the Lenovo Z5 when it was unveiled officially, and was just another iPhone X clone that could easily be forgotten amidst all the competition. Now, a company executive has confirmed that the upgraded Lenovo Z5 Pro smartphone is arriving on October 1, and the variant may sport some of what was promised by Chen, if not all of it. One of the executives at Lenovo has shared an image of Chen at a press conference in Beijing showcasing a notch-less Lenovo Z5 Pro. On Weibo, the executive said that the Lenovo Z5 Pro will be officially announced on October 1, which is considered to be National Day in China. The executive said that 'there are surprises on National Day, and that he will take care of the old Liu in the future' hinting at all the tall claims made by Cheng. In any case, a hands-on video of the Lenovo Z5 Pro was also leaked on Weibo recently showing a camera slider similar to the one we see on the Oppo Find X. In the video, it can be seen that the camera slides in and out manually, and not with the help of a motor - like on the Oppo Find X. Other details on the Lenovo Z5 Pro are scarce at the moment, and we refrain from speculating, given Lenovo's past experience of tall claims and underwhelming delivery. In any case, the Lenovo Z5 Pro will be official on October 1, with all official specifications and pricing details. "
GADGETS,Smartphone Users in India Consuming 1GB Data a Day on Average: Nielsen,09/28/18,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/telecom/news/smartphone-data-consumption-1923607,"Smartphone users in India are consuming an average 1GB data per day - from an average 4GB a month not long ago - and spending more than 90 minutes on online activities daily across the entry-level, mid-range and premium segments, a Nielsen India report said on Thursday. Additionally, the report said the average selling price of mobile phones is rising too thanks to growing demand for affordable smartphones. India has emerged among the most preferred smartphone markets in the world owing to affordable handset prices and low-cost data penetration, triggering a huge replacement demand among the customers across segments, the Nielsen Smartphone 2018 report added. ""The advent of high-speed 4G Internet, less-expensive mobile handsets and a correction in call data charges have encouraged the speedy adoption of smartphones in India,"" said Abhijit Matkar, Director-Technology IPG - Nielsen India. To meet the demand of the mass market, new Chinese and Indian handset makers have launched affordable handsets which are under Rs. 5,000. ""This sudden influx of affordable smartphones created a whole segment of new consumers who either upgraded from feature phones or were new mobile users altogether,"" Matkar said in a statement. When it comes to app usage, chat and VoIP apps dominate usage across customer segment followed by browser apps. Interestingly, uTorrent Beta app dominates across categories when it comes of consumption of data, followed by YouTube across customer segments, the findings showed. The smartphone users spend more than 90 minutes a day on online activities while the premium segment takes the usage up to 130 minutes per day. ""The price of handsets and data is emerging as a remarkable surrogate for monitoring the ever-widening set of users and their smartphone usage, thereby facilitating business and marketing strategy for better return on investment (ROI)"", Matkar added. Despite the availability of economically-priced smartphones, average smartphone prices are still increasing. ""In fact, the average cost has steadily risen from about Rs. 7,700 in 2015 to about Rs. 10,000 in 2017,"" said the report. The appetite for data consumption has risen over the last 15 to 18 months. The highest engagement occurs on apps that consume a lot of data like Facebook, WhatsApp Messenger, Instagram, and Google Chrome, the report added.   "

GADGETS,"OnePlus 6T Tipped to Sport Bigger 3,700mAh Battery, No 3.5mm Audio Jack",09/27/18,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/oneplus-6t-battery-capacity-3700mah-leaked-online-1923190,"Photo Credit: Weibo OnePlus 6T leaked battery image Leaks surrounding the OnePlus 6T device have been doing the rounds frequently these days, and now details about the battery capacity have surfaced. A new image leak suggests the OnePlus 6T battery capacity will be 3,700mAh, a considerable increase from the 3,300mAh battery seen on the OnePlus 6. Leaked renders suggest that the OnePlus 6T smartphone will sport a waterdrop-shaped notch, with minimal bezels on all sides. On the back, the smartphone is expected to sport a dual camera setup stacked vertically. A Weibo user in a post claims the OnePlus 6T will pack a 3,700mAh battery, accompanied by a photo of the battery. The image shows the battery model number, capacity, and clearly mentions ""Use specified OnePlus charger only."" This is a significant increase from the 3,300mAh battery of the OnePlus 6, and the company has managed to integrate the bigger battery by removing the 3.5mm audio jack. Co-founder Carl Pei recently confirmed to TechRadar that the OnePlus 6T won't have a 3.5mm audio jack, hinting indirectly at an increased battery. Though he never hinted of any such increase, but this leak seems to lend weight to the eventuality. While the 3,700mAh battery is a respectable increase, it still doesn't match up to other flagships that sport a 4,000mAh battery, such as the Galaxy Note 9. The tipster claims that OnePlus is gearing up to launch the smartphone sometime next month. The OnePlus 6T is also confirmed to sport an in-display fingerprint sensor, and will be one of the big highlights of the smartphone. Previous leaks suggest that the OnePlus 6T might sport a slightly larger 6.4-inch Optic AMOLED display panel with the same full-HD+ resolution.

GADGETS,Apple iPhone XR Reportedly Shifting Production to Foxconn From Pegatron Due to Manufacturing Issues,09/26/18,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/apple-iphone-xr-shift-production-foxconn-pegatron-manufacturing-issues-1922585,"Apple rejigs production plans due to delay in production Apple has reportedly shifted its production plans for the iPhone XR after one of its suppliers ran into manufacturing issues. The Cupertino giant is said to be switching a big chunk of iPhone XR's production to Foxconn from Pegatron. Apple at its launch event earlier this month unveiled three new iPhone models - iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR. While the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max started shipping from September 21 for the first wave of launch countries and in India it will become available from September 28. However, the iPhone XR will be available for pre-orders starting October 19, and its shipments will begin from October 26 in over 50 countries and territories, including India. According to a new report, one of Apple's manufacturing partners have been facing production issues. Citing a report from Chinese language Economic Daily News, Digitimes said that Apple had handed roughly 50 percent to 60 percent of the whole production of iPhone XR to Pegatron and about 30 percent to Foxconn. However, because of delayed shipments of key components as well as capacity constraints, the company was forced to switch the orders. After the decision, Pegatron is now dealing with less than 30 percent of iPhone XR's production. The report noted that Pegatron's production has been affected by a ""lower-than-expected yield rate and shortages of workers at its plants in China."" iPhone XR First Impressions The new iPhone lineup amounts to an upgrade over the iPhone X, with the premium iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max models shipping this month itself. However, the relatively cheaper variant called the iPhone XR that shares a similar design but misses out on a few features, will not be available until late October. To recall, a previous report had claimed that the reason for a delay in iPhone XR's shipping date could be both hardware and software issues. As it is, LCD display panels are not as easily bent as the OLED panels (like the ones used on iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max), essentially making a bezel-free design a challenge for the iPhone XR. In addition to the above, the latest report claims that the supply of the LCD displays used for the iPhone XR from Japan Display (JDI) has reportedly not been steady. Hopefully, Apple will be able to resolve the issues in iPhone XR's production before it available for preorder next month. Will Apple ever launch reasonably priced iPhones in India?

The first phone in this series is expected to sport an in-display fingerprint scanner, and now a new report reveals that the first P series devices may be called the Galaxy P30 and Galaxy P30+. A fresh report reveals that the devices may come in multiple colour options and two storage variants. The new Galaxy P30 and Galaxy P30+ smartphones are also expected to integrate the company's in-house mobile GPUs as well, to reduce reliance on Imagination Technologies - the company that offers PowerVR range of GPUs for mobile devices. According to Sammobile's sources, the Samsung Galaxy P30 will be launched in 64GB and 128GB storage models, and be available in four colour options - Blue, Pink, Black and Red colours.

It is also said to be working on a smartphone with four rear cameras on the back. "
GADGETS,OnePlus 6T Global Launch Event to be Held in India?,09/26/18,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/oneplus-6t-india-launch-date-october-17-invite-leaked-triple-camera-setup-1922473,"Photo Credit: Weibo OnePlus 6T India launch could be same day as the global launch OnePlus 6T is doing the rounds on the rumour mill quite frequently these days, with the launch expected in the next few weeks. An interesting piece of information has now surfaced online, showing an alleged invite for the India launch of the OnePlus 6T slated for October 17. Curiously, this invite has appeared on a Chinese social media website and not India, so it may well mean that the OnePlus 6T India launch could be the global unveiling of the smartphone. The invite shows off the new tagline ""Unlock The Speed"" most likely pointing towards the presence of an in-display fingerprint sensor. New renders of the upcoming flagship are also out that reveal a third camera sensor at the back, a departure from the dual rear camera setup of the OnePlus 6. The leak comes to us courtesy a user on Chinese social media website Weibo, as reported by WCCFTech. Interestingly, the October 17 date coincides with the date mentioned in the screenshot officially shared by OnePlus with CNET. Apart from the launch date, country, and tagline, the invite gives out no other details around the OnePlus 6T.  Photo Credit: Weibo   The same user has also released two new press renders that show a third camera sensor on the phone's back. This sensor is slightly separated from the other two sensors, leading us to believe that the OnePlus 6T TV ad in India shows Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan hiding the third sensor in the brief reveal. This is in line with previous leaks suggesting a triple camera setup on the smartphone, which was contradicted by noted tipster Roland Quandt, who said OnePlus will stick to the dual camera setup for its next flagship. However, as there is no official confirmation on the same, it is advisable to take this piece of information with a pinch of salt. OnePlus might not look to radically change the design considering that this is a mid-year ""T"" upgrade for its flagship range. Apart from the triple camera setup, a waterdrop-style notch is seen on the front with an in-display fingerprint sensor, as confirmed by OnePlus. As per what OnePlus has teased, the OnePlus 6T will not sport a 3.5mm headphone jack and instead will come bundled with a pair of USB Type-C earphones. Keeping in mind previous trends, the OnePlus 6T will most likely borrow a Snapdragon 845 SoC and RAM quantity of up to 8GB RAM from the OnePlus 6. It is expected to run Android 9.0 Pie out-of-the-box. As for pricing, back in August this year a report had suggested that the OnePlus 6T would continue the higher price trend and sport a price tag of $550 in the US, slight uptick from the OnePlus 6's base price. OnePlus 6T price in India is not known yet, but it will be exclusive to Amazon India as per a teaser on the e-tailer's website. "

But just months after the arrival of its first generation, the Chinese company has apparently started preparing its successor that could launch as the Black Shark 2. The new offering has received a TENAA certification with model number AWM-0. This is notably the same model that was assigned to the original Black Shark smartphone. However, there are certain design-level changes on the new model. The dual rear camera setup that was horizontally-aligned on the original model is now appeared to be vertically aligned. Similarly, the fingerprint sensor that was sitting on the front panel of the first-generation Black Shark has now been moved to the back of the Black Shark 2. The original Black Shark arrived in China with a starting price of CNY 2,999 (roughly Rs. 31,700). The Black Shark 2 is likely to carry a similar price tag for its base variant. As per the TENAA listing, as reported on SlashLeaks, the Black Shark 2 has a 5.99-inch display that could come with an FHD+ resolution - identical to the original model. The listing also highlights the presence of a 4,000mAh battery, which is the same as the predecessor. Further, the dimensions of the smartphone come at 160x75.26x8.7mm. These show that the new model is slightly thinner and compact in size than its previous generation that 9.25mm of thickness and 161.62mm of height. However, the width of the original model was almost the same as its new generation with 75.4mm of measurement. SlashLeaks has also provided a total of four images of the new Black Shark smartphone sourced from TENAA. While the side view of the new model looks similar to its predecessor, its back view shows some notable differences in the form of a vertically-placed dual rear camera setup and a fingerprint sensor. Since the fingerprint sensor is now at the back, the front view of the new model looks quite plain. Furthermore, the Black Shark branding along with the S-shaped logo can be seen on the back. The source at SlashLeaks wasn't able to provide any further details about the Black Shark 2. Similarly, the link to the TENAA listing on the SlashLeaks page was showing a ""no record"" page at the time of filing this story. If we look at the hardware of the original Black Shark smartphone, its successor is expected to be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 SoC, coupled with Adreno 630 GPU and up to 8GB of RAM. The smartphone could also have a dedicated liquid cooling technology to offer out-of-the-box thermal management for an enhanced gaming experience. Details about the price and availability of the Black Shark 2 are yet to be revealed. Nevertheless, considering the listing on TENAA, some more information about the developing model is likely to emerge in the coming future. "

There it was priced between $193.99 to $218.99 (around Rs. 14,100 to Rs. 15,900). Separately, we have an interesting hands-on look at the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro. This comes to us from one of India's biggest YouTubers, Gaurav Chaudhary, who runs the Technical Guruji channel. He claims that the phone's ""global version"" is already up for sale in Dubai much before the official launch. The retail box shown in the video reveals specifications such as dual cameras at the back and front (with the above mentioned sensor sizes), a 6.26-inch display, and a 4,000mAh battery. The YouTuber also states that a Snapdragon 636 SoC powers the phone's internals. The unit that he got a hold of comes in the 3GB RAM/ 32GB storage configuration, and is the Black colour option. Inside the box is a Micro-USB cable, a 10W adapter, a SIM ejector tool, and a TPU back case. Design of the smartphone looks largely similar to the Redmi Note 5 Pro except the display notch. It seems to be running MIUI 9.6 on top of Android 8.1 Oreo out-of-the-box. Chaudhary does reveal that the price in Dubai is around AED 750 (roughly Rs. 14,800) which is much lower than the one seen in the Moldova listing, leading us to believe that Xiaomi's pricing strategy would be different for Europe and Asia for the Redmi Note 6 Pro. The YouTuber also goes on to test out the performance, camera quality, and fingerprint sensor accuracy on the Redmi Note 6 Pro. Can Motorola One Power dethrone the Redmi Note 5 Pro and the Redmi 6 Pro?

GADGETS,Qualcomm Accuses Apple of Stealing Its Secrets to Help Intel,09/26/18,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/qualcomm-accuses-apple-of-stealing-its-secrets-to-help-intel-1922339,"Qualcomm on Tuesday accused Apple of stealing its chip-making secrets and giving them to rival Intel Corp, paving the way for Apple to switch to Intel's improved semiconductors, which may have cost Qualcomm billions of dollars in lost sales. The accusation, made in a legal filing on Tuesday, is the latest salvo in a drawn-out patent dispute between the two tech heavyweights. Qualcomm accused Apple of misusing secret Qualcomm software to share information about its chips with Intel engineers in a November lawsuit, but went further on Tuesday by saying Apple stole Qualcomm trade secrets as part of a ""multi-year campaign of sloppy, inappropriate and deceitful conduct"" designed to improve rivals' chipsets and ultimately divert Qualcomm's Apple-based business to Intel. Apple declined to comment. Intel, which is not named as a defendant in Qualcomm's lawsuit, declined to comment. The world's most valuable technology company previously used Qualcomm's modem chips in its iPhone, which helped the device connect to wireless data networks. With the iPhone 7, launched in 2016, Apple began using Intel modem chips in some models instead. Qualcomm told investors in July it believed its modem chips were completely removed from the newest generation of iPhones released this month, leaving Intel as the sole supplier. Teardowns of the new devices have confirmed that Intel is supplying the modem chips. Apple has cast doubt on Qualcomm's claims. Last month, it alleged that Qualcomm refused to answer its questions about which specific confidential information it had improperly shared with Intel. Apple has also alleged that it gave Qualcomm the chance to verify that Qualcomm's software had been used properly. The dispute, taking place in San Diego County Superior Court, is one strand of a wide-ranging legal battle in which Apple has accused Qualcomm of unfair patent licensing practices. Qualcomm, the world's largest mobile phone chipmaker, has in turn accused Apple of patent infringement. Qualcomm asked Judge Jacqueline Stern on Tuesday to allow it to attach the new allegations to its existing complaint rather than force it to file a new lawsuit. Discovery phaseQualcomm has previously said it gave Apple access to its confidential software tools to help Apple integrate its modem chips into the iPhone. On Tuesday, Qualcomm alleged that, since filing its lawsuit in November, it has discovered that Apple repeatedly used Qualcomm software to help Intel's engineers ""improve the sub-par performance of Intel's chipsets."" It did not present evidence or say how it found that out. The case is currently in the discovery phase, where parties can exchange evidence. Qualcomm's modems rely on a combination of chips and software to allow phones to receive wireless data. Qualcomm gave Apple access its source code and software development tools so Apple could modify Qualcomm's software for use in the iPhone, on the condition that Apple did not use the code or tools to help another chipmaker. In Tuesday's filing, Qualcomm alleged that Apple used the tools to open so-called ""log files"" from Qualcomm and then gave those files to Intel engineers. Log files contain rows of data generated by computer hardware or software, and engineers often analyse them to pinpoint technical problems and optimize the performance of a chip. ""Intel engineers even complained to Apple engineers about being unable to open Qualcomm log files, which Apple had provided to Intel, for lack of the appropriate Qualcomm tools,"" Qualcomm said in its filing. ""In response, Apple engineers routinely used Qualcomm tools to create post-processed log files, which they sent to Intel engineers to use in improving Intel's chipset solutions,"" it added. Qualcomm did not specify in its filing what within those log files, or within the other information Apple allegedly gave to Intel, constituted trade secrets. But it said the information helped Intel. ""It apparently improved Intel chipsets to the point where Apple decided to divert some of Qualcomm's Apple-based business to Intel,"" Qualcomm said in its filing. © Thomson Reuters 2018 "

However, all's not well in Apple land as some users have taken to Apple's Support forum and Reddit to report issues with the Wi-Fi or LTE connectivity on their newly-bought iPhone XS series models. A user last week posted an issue with Wi-Fi connectivity on Apple Support forums, as reported by 9to5Mac. ""I used to have full bars at my bed with iPhone X, now the Max only has 2. And it has trouble reconnect [sic] to the Wi-Fi after airplane mode is turned on with Wi-Fi turned on,"" he said. The post was followed by comments reporting Wi-Fi and Cellular issues with their respective iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max units. Users claim that their iPhone X, iPhone 7 Plus, and iPad (2017) work just fine with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi bands on their home networks. Moving on to Reddit where a post by user ""dvcspl"" has created an uproar among dozens of users who are experiencing the same issue on Apple's 2018 flagship iPhone models. Here a user claims that while signal bars remain similar to the level seen on iPhone X, overall speed is lower and the iPhone keeps switching to 2.4GHz Wi-Fi instead of the faster 5GHz option. Dozens also claim lower signals and speeds for LTE connectivity, once again with reports from both iPhone XS and iPhone Max users. Networking blog WiWaveLength published a blog post on Monday that speculates about the new development. According to the report, the RF performance loss may be linked to weak antenna gain which, likely, cannot be solved by putting a case on the iPhone in question. iOS revisions or carrier updates can change the way the baseband modems interact with wireless networks, but at this stage it's uncertain what's wrong. An official response by Apple is still awaited. "

GADGETS,"iPhone XS Max Outselling iPhone XS by 4 Times, Apple Watch Series 4 to Sell 19.5 Million Units This Year: Kuo",09/25/18,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/iphone-xs-max-outsells-iphone-xs-forecast-shipments-apple-watch-series-4-sales-1921992,"Kuo expects the iPhone 2018 range to sell about 75-80 million units in the launch period Apple earlier this month unveiled its latest full screen smartphones, the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and a cheaper iPhone XR. The former two went on sale last week in the first batch of countries and it is being reported that the larger iPhone XS Max is already outselling the iPhone XS by a huge margin. The Gold and Space Grey colour options of the iPhone XS Max are more popular than the Silver variant, and the 512GB storage option seems to be facing a shortage issue because of low NAND supply for the premium model, as per a noted analyst. These developments have been mentioned in an investor note by TF International Securities' analyst Ming-Chi Kuo as seen by Mac Rumors. Kuo believes that the iPhone XS Max is seeing up to three or four times the demand as compared to iPhone XS - better than expected, he added. He also claims that the predicted softness in demand in the Chinese market is proving to be wrong as shipments continue to remain high. He goes on to state that Apple's prosperity will continue to extend as far as early 2019, thanks to the release of the iPhone XR on October 19 that will further fuel sales given its relatively affordable price tag and high-end internals. Shaped LCD panels, the ones used on the iPhone XR to accommodate the display notch design, were behind the 30-odd day delay in iPhone XR shipments. Kuo believes October will see improvement in deliveries of this LCD component. Kuo expects the iPhone 2018 range to sell about 75-80 million units in the launch period, exact duration of which was not specified. The fourth quarter is also expected to create a record for Apple considering the iPhone average selling price is expected to exceed the market expectation of $750-770. As for the Apple Watch Series 4 lineup, Ming-Chi Kuo expects about 19.5 million units to ship before the end of the year, a substantial uptick from last year's 18 million. This owes most to the radical design and new features. Earlier this month, Kuo had predicted that the Apple Watch Series 4 would garner about 18 million sales by the end of this year. He had also said that the iPhone XR will account for about 55 to 60 percent of total iPhone 2018 sales, followed by iPhone XS Max at about 30 percent.

RHA is known for high quality audio products and enters the fully wireless market with the RHA TrueConnect earbuds, available in 10 days for $169.95. Also: The RHA MA-450i earphones sound better than their $50 price (review) While I enjoy the AirPods, they are not water or sweat resistant, fall out if I move too much, and have limited functionality with Android phones. RHA's new TrueConnect earbuds are powered with Bluetooth 5 and have tap controls on both earbuds to control audio playback, change volume, control calls, and activate your preferred digital assistant. Specifications of the RHA TrueConnect include: A standard USB-C cable is used to charge up the earbud carrying/charging case. In typical RHA fashion, the charging case uses high quality materials, including metal, to secure the earbuds and also look good in your mobile collection. The stem design, as compared to the full bud-only design like we see on the Jabra Elite Active 65t, was intentional in order to extend the mic down toward your mouth for improved call performance. Also: RHA intros first Bluetooth planar magnetic in-ear headphones CNET Kyle Hutchison, head of product design at RHA, stated: You can pre-order the TrueConnect earbuds now with availability scheduled to start on 18 October.

ZDNet,"Two weeks, too big: Goodbye Apple iPhone XS Max",10/08/18,https://www.zdnet.com/article/two-weeks-too-big-goodbye-apple-iphone-xs-max/,"top picks The 10 best smartphones of 2018 CES and MWC are over and it's time to clear the dust and see what smartphones are leading the pack this year. Read More When last year's Apple iPhone X was released I was thrilled with it due to the small overall size, large screen, minimal bezels, touch gestures, and more. Four months after I owned one I gave up Android as my primary platform and used the iPhone X until last month. After using the Apple iPhone XS Max, see our full review, for the past two weeks it is time to send it back to T-Mobile. The large form factor offers nothing unique over the iPhone XS and even though I usually like big phones this 6.5 inch iPhone doesn't excite me like the iPhone X. Also: iPhone XS Max review: The iPhone's future is big and bright A plus-sized phone with no plus optimization The iPhone Plus models of the past came with some functions found in the iPad, such as landscape home screen support, split-screen mode, and more extensive landscape support for apps. While the iPhone XS Max has a substantially larger display than the iPhone X/XS, none of these Plus features are supported. The iPhone XS Max is just a bigger iPhone XS Max with the accompanying larger display and larger capacity battery. As Brandon mentions in the embedded video below, the XS Max battery capacity is only 19 percent higher than that found on the iPhone XS. This is a much smaller difference between standard and Plus models of the past. Other big phones offer more One reason my wife keeps using Samsung Galaxy phones is the better cellular reception, especially in weak signal areas. While I haven't seen WiFi issues as some have reported, I have seen the Galaxy Note 9 and Huawei P20 Pro outperform the iPhone XS Max in terms of cellular reception. The Samsung Galaxy Note 9 also offers something unique with the S Pen that helps justify the large size of the phone. Samsung also has higher screen density so you can see more on the phone while the larger iPhone XS Max doesn't offer much of a difference over the iPhone XS. Also: iPhone XS Max first impressions: It's big, but not too big The battery life of the iPhone XS Max is fine and likely to get you through a full day, but the Huawei P20 Pro can get you through two. The upcoming Huawei Mate 20 devices are also likely to be multi-day phones with massive battery capacity. Thank you T-Mobile I purchased the iPhone X last year using the T-Mobile Jump on Demand program and used that program to purchase the iPhone XS Max. Thankfully, I can return the XS Max today and then choose to keep my current iPhone X or switch to the iPhone XS. Given there is no difference in monthly payments, I am likely going to switch to an iPhone XS in a couple of weeks. Also: How easy is it to break the new Apple iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max? Given that you can switch every 30 days if you like, I could even make the jump to an iPhone XR. The XR is possibly going to be the most compelling iPhone this year with the lower price, vivid color options, and most of the internals seen on the iPhone XS and XS Max. It is wonderful that the cameras and all internal specs, except the battery of course, of the smaller iPhone are the same as the larger iPhone since I hated that Apple required you to purchase the larger size phone just to get all that Apple had to offer in an iPhone. However, this year that means I will either keep my iPhone X or pick p the iPhone XS for the improved cameras, processor, and slightly higher water resistance.

ZDNet,InvisibleShield Glass+ VisionGuard for Apple iPhone XS Max: Protection for your screen and your eyes,10/06/18,https://www.zdnet.com/article/invisibleshield-glass-visionguard-for-apple-iphone-xs-max-protection-for-your-screen-and-your-eyes/,"Glass screen protectors today are a common accessory where the tempered glass acts as a sacrificial panel to fail when you drop your phone so that the actual phone display remains intact. The newest ZAGG InvisibleShield Glass+ VisionGuard product is now available for your Apple iPhone X, XS, and XS Max for $44.99. The cost to replace a broken iPhone XS Max display is $29 with AppleCare+ and $329 if you do not have Apple's coverage. There is also an initial $199 fee for AppleCare+ for the iPhone XS Max, in addition to the screen replacement service fees. $228 or $329 is a lot to pay to repair a display so it seems prudent to spend about $45 to protect it and avoid these costs. Also: iPhone XS Max review: The iPhone's future is big and bright Product details The screen protector is a tempered glass protector that has ZAGG's EyeSafe technology that is designed to filter out portions of the harmful high energy visible (HEV) blue light spectrum coming from the device screen. Over the last couple of years we have seen companies including blue light/night modes where the light is changed in color to help protect our eyes from our displays. According to The Nielsen Company, the average adult spends more than nine hours per day looking at computer and phone screens. ZAGG stated that this prolonged exposure to HEV blue light contributes to digital eye strain which can cause dry and irritated eyes, sleep disruption and loss, blurred vision, and premature eye aging. The EyeSafe layer should help, but this isn't something I could test in a week or two. The screen protector features Ion Matrix technology and is advertised as adding three times the shatter protection of an unprotected screen. Installation With the flat iPhone XS Max display and EZ Apply Tray that serves as an alignment guide to help you simply place the protector down onto your phone there was no need for multiple attempts to line up the protector. I cleaned the display, used the dust removal sticker (before and after installing the EZ Apply Tray), and then confirmed there was not a spec of dust on the screen. I peeled off the back of the front glass protector and placed it down within the EZ Apply Tray using the two clear tabs. Start from the center and press down on the protector towards the edges to press it into place. Remove the EZ Apply Tray and remove the back protective plastic sheet, with the two tabs on it, from the display. My installation was flawless and there is not a single bubble under the protector. I was actually a bit stunned at how perfect the installation went since I thought there were bubbles present, but these were just bubbles under the back protective plastic installation sheet. Daily usage experiences It will take long term use to see if there is any noticeable relief from eye strain due to the protector, but it seems to me you would want this so why not choose this over a standard glass display for just a few more dollars. The iPhone XS Max has the best display of any smartphone and this glass protector doesn't take away anything from its brilliance. Also: iPhone XS Max vs Samsung Galaxy Note 9: We compare the big phones The fit is perfect and covers the entire viewable area. There is a bit of space around the edges so that you can use any case you like, such as the new Nomad Horween leather Rugged case or Rugged Tri-Folio, which are the ones I tested with this screen protector in place. Visibility and touch sensitivity have not been impacted in any way with this protector installed. Performance has been flawless and I have a bit more peace of mind using my iPhone XS Max. My daughter recently dropped her iPhone 7 and the glass protector shattered while the iPhone's display was safe and sound. Given the extremely high cost of the iPhone XS Max, spending $44.95 for glass protection is a worthy investment with no real sacrifice in usability. "
ZDNet,"What to expect: Pixel 3, OnePlus 6T, and other phones coming this fall",10/04/18,https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-upcoming-future-phones/,"top picks The 10 best smartphones of 2018 CES and MWC are over and it's time to clear the dust and see what smartphones are leading the pack this year. Read More All major smartphones have been announced for the first half of 2018 and our 10 best smartphones list gets refreshed with new releases, when they are worthy of consideration. There are also many low-cost smartphones with more likely to come from Honor, Motorola, LG, Samsung, and others. Some phones are on a fairly regular release schedule, but others appear out of the blue. As we look across the next couple of months, there are several likely new phones coming soon. 1. Google Pixel 3 and 3 XL Google I/O is where Google provides glimpses of what is to come with its next mobile operating system, followed by public betas that people can test on various phones. Android Pie has now been released for existing phones like the Pixel 2 and Essential Phone with several more leaks of the Google Pixel 3 and 3 XL. Google has confirmed that we will see new hardware on October 9. Given what we see in Android Pie, it is possible that the next Pixel phones will have a dual camera setup, although Google has also showed it can make a fantastic camera with just one lens. More improvements in processing may be presented, whether this is through one or two cameras. A large version with a notch is likely, along with increased storage capacity and battery life. Apple set the bar for 3D face scanning and it is possible Google will release a similar system this year. LG, HTC, Huawei, and Samsung have made past Google Pixel devices and rumors indicate HTC may be the ones making these Pixel 3 devices. We will find out everything next week in NYC. 2. Apple iPhone XR Apple's iPhone XS Max and XS are now available to purchase. A third iPhone was also announced last month and the iPhone XR will be released on 26 October. The iPhone XR will start at $749 and offers much of the same internal specifications we see in the iPhone XS and XS Max. A LCD display is incorporated, while various colors will be offered as well. The iPhone XR has a single 12-megapixel camera, but will still support Portrait mode and more. It may be the hit iPhone of 2018. 3. Huawei Mate 20 Pro Similar to Apple, Google, and Samsung, Huawei has set the fall up for an annual release of its Mate series. Last year's Mate 10 Pro actually launched with a US variant that was available from select retailers after the US carrier deals fell through due to US government intervention. Rumors and leaks indicate that the Mate 20 Pro will have an even larger battery than the massive 4,000 mAh one we see in the current Mate 10 Pro and Huawei P20 Pro. Samsung just released the Note 9 with a 4,000 mAh battery and it looks like Huawei is ready to trump them already. The Mate 20 Pro may also go big with the display, rumored at this time to have a 6.9 inch screen. It could possibly have three rear cameras like the P20 Pro. The Mate 20 Pro may even incorporate the in-screen fingerprint scanner like Huawei has on the Huawei Porsche Design Mate RS. 4. OnePlus 6T The OnePlus 6, see our full review, is one of the best flagship competitors we have seen in a long time. The OnePlus 6T will be launching on T-Mobile, a first for OnePlus, and looks to likely offer a few improvements over the OnePlus 6. Changes over the OnePlus 6 include an in-display fingerprint scanner and no 3.5mm headset jack. It may cost more than the current OnePlus 6 and is likely to launch in mid-October. "

ZDNet,Spotify integration comes to Samsung Music,10/03/18,https://www.zdnet.com/article/spotify-integration-comes-to-samsung-music/,"top picks The 10 best smartphones of 2018 CES and MWC are over and it's time to clear the dust and see what smartphones are leading the pack this year. Read More One of the companies who appeared on stage at the Galaxy Note 9 Unpacked event in NYC was Spotify. As a family Spotify plan subscriber I was excited to see what this partnership might bring and yesterday I updated the Samsung Music app on my Note 9 to test out this integration. Also: The first Android phone was an ugly thing, and I loved it CNET Samsung Music was updated to include Spotify integration. On your compatible Samsung device one of the optional tabs, in addition to artist, playlist, album, etc, is Spotify. When you swipe over to the Spotify tab you will find a number of different playlists to choose from. Tapping on one will open up that playlist within Spotify, taking you out of Samsung Music. I understand that the playlist selection will adapt over time as your listening preferences are recognized. In addition, when you search for music the results will not only include your own music library, but Spotify content. Samsung Music was primarily designed as the app for you to use with your own offline music content and with a microSD card inside devices like the Note 9 I load up the card with my 4GB of music. The integration with Spotify is great as it gives me the option to have one interface for music selection and control. Also: 17 ways to recycle or sell your smartphone TechRepublic Spotify is also integrated into the Samsung Galaxy Watch, which is one major reason I prefer it over the Apple Watch. This support includes offline syncing of Spotify content so that you can load up music on the watch and play it without an active phone connection while running or working out.

ZDNet,Apple iPhone XS Max OtterBox case roundup: Three options for adding rugged drop protection,09/30/18,https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-iphone-xs-max-otterbox-case-roundup-three-options-for-adding-rugged-drop-protection/,"The Apple iPhone XS Max, see our  	full review, is a big, beautiful iPhone. With the large size and slick glass panels, it is also easy to drop. While it has Apple's strongest glass, putting this expensive phone in a case is a smart move. top picks The 10 best smartphones of 2018 CES and MWC are over and it's time to clear the dust and see what smartphones are leading the pack this year. Read More OtterBox has  	48 total case options for protecting your iPhone XS Max in the form of Defender, Commuter, Symmetry, Strada, Statement, Pursuit, Defender Pro, and Traction series cases. Over the past week I have been using Pursuit, Commuter, and Defender Pro Series cases with my iPhone XS Max being carried in one for my shipyard visit next week. Also: iOS 12: Release date, new features, and hidden features CNET All three of the cases I tested have  	OtterBox Certified Drop+ Protection, which means the case has passed more than 24 test over more than 238 hours. Looking at the list of tests, it is impressive what these cases go through to earn this certification. While I found all of these cases to be solid options with good drop protection and attractive styling, the least expensive one, the Commuter Series, was my personal favorite. The ringer switch access was too inconvenient for me on the Pursuit and the Defender Series Pro was more protection than I need for daily carry. OtterBox Pursuit Series This is the first time I've tried out a  	Pursuit Series case on a phone and it's a great case for adding drop protection without too much bulk. This is a two piece case with most of the case composed of the back panel that extends up around the four edges. A hard plastic piece snaps into the front to lock the case onto your phone. It took some effort to work around the outside edges of the case to get the material around the edges to work up and over the plastic front frame piece. I discovered using a SIM card removal tool worked as a lever to slide around the edges as I worked the rubber over the edges and locked into the channel on the front frame. Once all is locked in, I loved the angle of the front face that leads down to the glass display. Also: macOS Mojave: A look at the new features TechRepublic The Pursuit Series case covers every port, except for the ringer switch opening. I have short fingernails and had some difficulty in working the ringer switch so I would prefer to have a piece over this that would allow me to manipulate the ringer switch more easily. There is a cover over the Lightning charging port on the bottom. Rather than speaker openings along the bottom, there are openings in the plastic front frame piece so that audio is directed forward towards you for an enhanced audio experience. There is also an integrated lanyard opening on the bottom so you can safely carry your iPhone XS Max around with you too. Apple Pay and wireless charging work with your iPhone XS Max in this case so there is no real need to worry about uncovering the bottom Lightning port. Raised buttons over the volume and right side buttons make it very easy to manipulate and use these keys. The rear camera opening and case design make the camera flush to the back. I tested a black case with clear back that shows off your iPhone. There are also black, burgundy/gray, brown/green color options. The Pursuit Series case is available now for $79.95. This is an excellent case for protection with OtterBox Drop+ certification. OtterBox Defender Series Pro The  	$69.95 OtterBox Defender Series Pro is the most protective offering from OtterBox, comprised of three layers to help your chances for iPhone survival in the case of an accidental drop. There are two pieces to the hard plastic inner frame; a back piece that includes the four sides with a soft foam shock layer inside the back and a minimal front frame that snaps securely into place. After these two pieces secure around your iPhone XS Max, then the outside thick silicone slipcover fits over the plastic frame pieces. This outer layer has port covers for the ringer switch and Lightning port with raised buttons for volume and the right side function button. Also: How easy is it to break the new Apple iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max? There is an opening on the back for the dual cameras with a glossy black plastic area around the camera. I have seen no degradation on photo quality even though the camera is set down in a bit with the case on the iPhone XS Max. The iPhone feels very secure in this case and you can trust it will protect your phone. The front is raised above the display so there is a few millimeter gap when you set your phone face down on a table. There is no screen protection, but if you want that then you can add a screen protector. OtterBox has the  	Alpha Glass protector available for $39.95. The OtterBox Defender case package also includes a holster so you can carry your iPhone XS Max on your belt. The hard plastic frame is easy to snap your iPhone in and out of with a belt clip that opens about half an inch to attach to your belt. The belt clip rotates around 360 degrees in increments of 30 degrees to fit your situation perfectly. If you watch media on your iPhone, you may be pleased to know the holster also functions as a hands-free kickstand. Simply rotate the belt clip until the two holster corners are on the bottom and then press in on the top of the belt clip until it snaps open and locks into the top of the belt clip spring. The Defender Pro Series case also has OtterArmor Microbial Defense, which means there is some protection on the case to protect it from common germs. It does not protect you, the screen, or holster. The case is reasonably priced for something this protective and well designed. It comes in black, Purple Nebula, teal (Big Sur), and Dark Lake blue. I tested the Big Sur model and it looks great. OtterBox Commuter Series The  	Commuter Series is available for $49.95 and is one of the most popular case options available from OtterBox. It is also a two-piece solution with an inner soft layer and a hard plastic outer shell. It is very easy to put your iPhone in the case and also to remove it if you desire. The inner soft layer helps offer some shock protection while the hard plastic outer shell deflects impacts. The hard outer layer covers about a third of each side, the bottom two corners with most of the bottom protected, and about 80 percent of the top in the center area. There is an opening in both layers on the back for the Apple logo on the back of the iPhone. Also: Meet Apple's iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR: Prices and specs There is also an opening in the back for the camera and with this case design there is more rear thickness than the Pursuit Series so the camera is sunk down a bit more from the back. I have not seen any impact on the quality of photos with any of these cases. There is also a ringer switch opening on the Commuter Series, but I am able to manipulate it easier than I can with the Pursuit Series. There are also openings on the bottom for the mic and speaker. Again, the raised buttons are easy to find and use on this case.

I was primarily interested in testing out the Rugged Tri-Folio in rustic brown because I've never seen a folio with a tri-fold arrangement. On my commuter train it seems just about every other person has some kind of folio case for their phone where cash, credit cards, transit cards, door access cards, and more are carried in one accessory.

ZDNet,iPhone XS Max vs Samsung Galaxy Note 9: We compare the big phones,09/28/18,https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-xs-max-vs-samsung-galaxy-note-9-we-compare-the-big-phones/,"Apple set the bar for high-priced smartphones last year with the iPhone X starting at $999. This year's Samsung Galaxy Note 9 pushed that by 99 cents to a starting price of $999.99, followed soon after by Apple's even higher priced iPhone XS Max starting at $1,099. If you want either of these new smartphones, prepare to put down more than $1,000 or else finance it through the manufacturer or your local carrier to spread the pain out over two years. The iPhone Xs Max and Galaxy Note 9 are both extremely powerful smartphones with today's highest specifications, advanced dual rear cameras, battery life that will last you at least a day, and a size that pushes the limits and requires two hands to comfortably navigate. While they may look similar on paper, they each have a slightly different focus too and you may come to prefer one over the other like I have. Also: iPhone XS Max review: The iPhone's future is big and bright Tale of the tape Specifications don't provide the complete picture regarding the capabilities of a smartphone, but they are useful for comparison purposes and to provide you with an indication on what each manufacturer is providing. Both devices are great for business with large displays, excellent cameras, long battery life, and secure lock options. They also both have an IP68 dust and water resistant rating with a vast case and accessory market ready to outfit and protect your new expensive smartphone. Due to my role here at ZDNet to test out and write about various smartphones, I currently own both of these flagship smartphones and both are being paid via monthly payment plans. I'm on the Samsung Galaxy Upgrade program for the Note 9 and using T-Mobile Jump On Demand for the Apple iPhone XS Max. However, most people will only choose one of these devices so let's look a bit closer at what makes each different from the other to see if there is one that fits your needs better. If I did have to choose just one, then it would be the Galaxy Note 9 as you can see below.

My 10 best smartphones list will be updated as soon as we see what LG, Google, and Huawei have to announce in the next couple of weeks. Until then, the Galaxy Note 9 lives at the top of that list and it is going to take something special to knock it from that spot. The Galaxy Note 9 has been in my hands now for more than a month. Here are features of the Note 9 that make it a compelling choice for business: Why pick the Apple iPhone XS Max? For the first time in many years, I kept the iPhone X in hand and in use for an entire year. The iPhone usually bores me after a few months and I move on to the next shiny Android phone, but the iPhone X kept me excited for many months. After a week using the iPhone XS Max, I'm not sure if it is staying or if I am sticking with the compact, pocket-friendly iPhone X. The iPhone XS Max is a great technological improvement over the iPhone X, as clearly stated by Jason in his full review. Here are some reasons to choose the iPhone XS Max over the Note 9: If you prefer a particular operating system over the other, then it's a clear choice which is best for you. However, you may be like my coworker and willing to switch your entire ecosystem to get the feature you like. It's really not difficult to switch between the platforms today with most everything syncing to cloud accounts. Which device do you prefer?

ZDNet,"Samsung's S Pen is fantastic, but Bixby is another good reason to buy the Galaxy Note 9",09/26/18,https://www.zdnet.com/article/samsungs-s-pen-is-fantastic-but-bixby-is-another-reason-to-buy-the-galaxy-note-9/,"The Samsung Galaxy Note 9 is a stunning smartphone and the longer I use it the more essential it becomes to my optimal productivity. I've focused on the utility of the S Pen, but over the past week I've spent time focusing on another unique Samsung feature, Bixby. top picks The 10 best smartphones of 2018 CES and MWC are over and it's time to clear the dust and see what smartphones are leading the pack this year. Read More In most of my articles where I discuss Samsung products, I've panned Bixby as a weakness of a Samsung phone or watch. Samsung has included a dedicated button on its flagship phones for Bixby and most reviewers and Samsung users seem to disable or reprogram that button. Full review here: Samsung Galaxy Note 9: Big battery,superb S Pen experience power productivity After finally spending some dedicated time with Bixby, I want to say I am sorry for being so harsh about it in past writing. Bixby is often comapred to Apple's Siri, Google Assistant, Microsoft Cortana, and Amazon Alexa, but it is really not focused on being a voice-controlled search engine. Bixby will not always provide you with the next date your favorite team plays, the current score of a ballgame, or answers to trivia questions. It is an assistant that is designed to optimize the use of your hardware while also providing some of the other search capabilities of other assistants. The real power I now enjoy using is found in the Quick Commands functionality. Tap the Bixby hardware button and then in the upper right corner with the three dot menu icon tap it and choose Quick Commands. Samsung provides several sample/recommended Quick Commands that you can use or select and then modify. One very interesting aspect of these is the three or more commands listed below the command word or words. One sample is called Going Home and by stating this phrase you will see your device turn on Bluetooth, turn off Wi-Fi, and send a text message that you are on your way home. My longest current Quick Command has six command lines in it and it is called Good Morning. Here is what happens when I launch Bixby and say good morning: The possibilities are nearly endless with Quick Commands and I continue to monitor actions I perform regularly to see if a Quick Command can be created to make my Note 9 work for me, which is exactly what these smartphones should be doing for us. Some others I have set up control my work settings, switch to Android Auto while driving, open apps like Gmail/Twitter/Microsoft Teams/Google News, and make a payment with Samsung Pay. Do you have any favorites that I should explore? Also: Android Auto is finally ready to go wireless, mostly CNET In addition to these Quick Commands, Bixby is set up to perform a ton of functions on your phone in a natural way without you having to always state specific words or phrases. There are quite a few third party apps that support deep Bixby functionality with a SDK available so developers can continue to enhance apps for Bixby support. With the upcoming Samsung Galaxy Home speaker, it is likely we will see even more Bixby support coming in the near future. Even if you tried Bixby before and hated it, I recommend spending more time with it and exploring the Quick Commands to see if your Samsung Galaxy phone or Galaxy Watch can make you more efficient. Bixby 2.0 launched on the Note 9 and includes more natural language predictions so you can carry out longer conversations/searches with Bixby understanding the context of your first query when you follow up with less complete commands. Bixby will also learn your preferences over time so the more you use it the better it will be. Soon there should be more Mexican food restaurants offered up since that is one of my all-time favorite places to eat. Also: 15 handy Samsung Bixby tricks you need to know CNET While Quick Commands are very useful, some of the fairly basic Bixby commands I've used before (send a specific photo to a friend via text message) do not appear to be working and stop at the share screen. I'll continue to explore these and hope for more Bixby updates. The S Pen is one reason to buy a Note 9 and Bixby is another. I have the left Bixby button set to a single press to launch and am now using Bixby every single day. here's the Samsung Note 9 "
ZDNet,New Apple connection problem? iPhone XS users report subpar cell and Wi-Fi reception,09/25/18,https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-apple-connection-problem-iphone-xs-users-report-subpar-cell-and-wi-fi-reception/,"Apple iPhone XS event Eight years ago, Apple's iPhone 4 struggled with an antenna design problem that came to be known as       Antennagate. Apple's proposed solution at the time: Change the way you held the phone or use a bumper case. The new iPhone Xs Max and iPhone Xs launched late last week, and over the last few days reports of connection issues in low signal areas have appeared on various Apple and MacRumors forums and on social networks. It's worth noting that forums are places where people go to share problems; when things are going well, people do not generally visit a forum and speak up. Forum users are reporting weaker signals and poorer performance with the new iPhone models while in low signal areas. Many of these people still have last year's iPhone X in hand -- or have just traded them in -- so they are able to offer up comparisons between  their previous model and the new 2018 iPhone model. Also: How to decide: Picking the 2018 iPhone that's right for you On the other hand, there are also many replies on websites like    The Verge and on social networks from users who are seeing the same or better signal performance on the new iPhone Xs and Xs Max. At this time, it is hard to quantify if this is a widespread, global issue or affecting just a small percentage of iPhone users. It also appears that the reports are coming primarily from areas with weak signal coverage; those in large cities or urban areas may not be seeing any connection issues if coverage is generally strong all of the time. Speed tests also are generally showing good results, but speed tests are not telling much about the signal strength in marginal coverage areas. Some early theories suggested the move away from using Qualcomm processors -- all new iPhone models have Intel modems -- is a possible cause of the connection issues. However, Andrew Shepherd, who has been spending some time analyzing recent FCC reports, explains why  the change in modems is likely not the cause of these reported connection concerns. iPhone X FCC EIRP results  Shepherd's analysis of FCC lab tests show that the observed performance of EIRP (Equivalent Isotropically Radiated Power) for the new iPhone Xs and Xs Max indicate there could be issues in low signal areas. The weak antenna gain identified by Shepherd could possibly be addressed by increasing the conducted power through a software update or increase antenna gain via a hardware manufacturing revision. iPhone Xs FCC EIRP results  It is not just cellular reception issues that people are writing about; flaky Wi-Fi connectivity with 5GHz networks looks to be a common theme. Reports comparing older iPhones with the 2018 models indicate less than half the speed over Wi-Fi. Another theory being suggested is related to software and Apple's management of LTE bands. With these new iPhones having 4x4 MIMO support for the first time, it's possible a firmware update or carrier settings update could resolve any band switching issues. The connection concerns are reported in areas of weak signal when a phone is more likely to switch to other bands to try to maintain a connection. Update: Mr. Shepherd posted an updated blog post to clarify his analysis and try to keep people on track for what the FCC results showed and what his conclusions are. I believe I capture things correctly in this post, but to make sure wanted to share the link to his latest so that nothing is taken out of context. Also: iPhone XS: A cheat sheet for professionals TechRepublic I've had an iPhone X for about a year and it has  always performed worse than Samsung and other Android phones on T-Mobile. My iPhone Xs Max, again on T-Mobile, arrived today so I will be able to capture some direct dBm readings on the iPhone X and Xs Max at the same time to see if there are reception issues firsthand. Several websites have reached out to Apple for comment. It's likely too early in the cycle to quantify any issue, but if you have an iPhone Xs or Xs Max we would appreciate knowing the details of your connection performance. You can check your dBm signal strength by performing a  field test on your iPhone. Android users can simply check their connection performance in settings.

ZDNet,Moment anamorphic lens and photo case for Samsung Galaxy Note 9: Make cool movies with your phones,09/19/18,https://www.zdnet.com/article/moment-anamorphic-lens-and-photo-case-for-samsung-galaxy-note-9-make-cool-movies-with-your-phones/,"here's the Samsung Note 9 I need a good smartphone camera because my photography skills are quite limited. Thankfully, the cameras today have software to help out while companies like  	Moment make lenses and advanced software to help you use those lenses. For the past couple of weeks I have been testing out the  	Moment anamorphic lens and as you can see in my video sample below I still have a lot of work before someone mistakes my work for that of J.J. Abrams. Anamorphic lenses provide a widescreen, letterboxed look with signature flares in lighted conditions. I tried to capture some of that in Vegas, but it is going to take some more practice shooting with lots of improvement in editing to satisfy me with the results. Also: How to run your business from your smartphone TechRepublic The Moment anamorphic lens works with various Moment Photo cases and its Battery Photo case on iPhone, Galaxy, and Pixel phones. I bought Photo cases for the Galaxy Note 9, iPhone X, and Galaxy S9 Plus to use with my existing  	Moment wide-angle lens and also test out the upcoming anamorphic lens. You can pre-order the anamorphic lens for $119.99 (regular price is $149.99). Moment has shipped about 1,500 lenses so far with plans to ship about 500 a week. I highly recommend you check out the  	Getting Started video for this lens since it is unique and may quickly turn into your favorite new smartphone accessory. Lens hardware The anamorphic lens is a 1.33x version with metal and glass construction. It comes with a rubber lens cap to protect the front glass and a small drawstring bag to carry the lens. The microfiber bag can also be used to clean the lens. One feature that is unique to the Moment anamorphic lens is that the bayonet, back square part, of the lens rotates when you loosen the set screw with the included hex tool that is secured to the microfiber bag. To shoot with the anamorphic lens, it is important to have the right orientation of the lens and smartphones today have cameras oriented in both horizontal and vertical directions. Position 1 of the lens works with the older 6 through 8 iPhones, Pixel and Pixel 2, Galaxy S8/S9, Note 8/9, and other horizontal oriented cameras. Position 2 works with vertical-oriented cameras like the Apple iPhone X/Xs/Xs Max and Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus. There is an alignment guide provided in the anamorphic lens box to help you out. Also: Why iPhone and Android phone prices will get even higher CNET You will know when you have it right if you look at the lens and the oblong opening is in the vertical orientation when your phone is held in landscape for video capture. You should also see a blue vertical line reflecting off the lens when you have the orientation correct. A new Photo case or Battery Photo case is required to use the anamorphic case. Photo cases are priced at $29.99 and come in black canvas or walnut wood back options. The Note 9 ones should ship in a week or two (I tested an early unit) with the new generation of iPhone Xs Max cases available for pre-order. The iPhone X case works for the Xs. There is a white and tan leather option available for the new iPhones with these cases scheduled for mid-November shipping. Anamorphic lens specifications  Moment software Moment provides  	applications for iOS and Android with the iOS app launching with the newest features first and adding functionality that Apple does not provide, namely RAW image capture support. Currently, only the  	iOS app is designed to work with the anamorphic lens although you can use the default camera application on your Android phone to capture video content with the anamorphic lens. Anamorphic video is squeezed when using standard camera applications with the lens. The iOS Moment app lets you select the anamorphic lens from the drop-down so it is then de-squeezed when you record so you can enjoy the results right away. When I was shooting with the Note 9, I then had to do a bit of post-processing to de-squeeze the video. I found that  	Handbrake works fine and is a free option for this de-squeezing, but look forward to the upcoming Moment app update that does this for me on the phone. One section of my video, the dessert line in the Bellagio, was shot when I had the de-squeeze option turned off on my iPhone X so it did not turn out as intended. Also: Top-notch phones: 8 phones with display cut-outs Beyond the anamorphic de-squeezing functionality, the iOS app has all sorts of advanced camera controls that are not found on the simplistic application provided by Apple. You can use 3D touch for a shutter button with half a press to focus and a full press to capture, view histogram data live, create cinematic video, have full manual control of the camera, enable manual focus, and shoot RAW format photos. Samsung Galaxy Note 9 Photo case While I wait for my own walnut Note 9 case, Moment sent along a  	black canvas one to test out with the Moment anamorphic lens. This model is available for pre-order at a special price of just $23.99 so if you are interested in using Moment lenses now is a good time to pick up a Photo case for new devices. I like these Moment photo cases for daily use even if I am not using a lens since they do not add much size or weight, enhance the grip of my phone, and provides some drop protection at a reasonable price. Wireless charging and Samsung Pay are fully supported while using the case and there is even a  	wrist strap opening so you can carry your phone around easily like a camera. The bottom ports are fully accessible and it is easy to remove the S Pen. The volume and power buttons could be a bit more prominent, but you do get used to using them. I find the opening for the fingerprint sensor to be a tad bit small, but the Note 9 sensor is fast and accurate so I just recommend you train your finger with the Note 9 in the Photo case for best performance. Other Moment gear being tested Moment also sells a  	lens case for $19.99 that easily held to lenses safely in a divided compartment with a zippered lid. There is a small mesh pocket to put other pieces in, but if you own more than one lens then you should consider this case. A month ago I purchased a DJI Osmo Mobile 2 gimbal, but I am still testing it as I try to get comfortable shooting video with it. Moment offers a  	universal gimbal counterweight for $39.99 that is shipping in late October. It has two 30 gram weights and works with a number of gimbals, but I need to test it more before sharing my experiences. Moment offers a  	lens pen for $9.99 that you can use to clean both your lens and your phone camera glass clean. There is a small cleaning tip on one end and a larger brush tip on the other. Instructions are also provided for this accessory. Experiences using the lens It was easy to rotate the anamorphic lens between the two orientations for the different phones I was using and the lens cap was great for keeping the lens protected while carrying the phone and lens in my pocket. After using the anamorphic lens with both an iPhone and a Galaxy phone, I prefer the iPhone experience at this time due to the current capability of the Moment application to de-squeeze the video on the fly. I need to improve my photo editing/post-processing skills, but given my limited available time I don't see how I can spend hours post-processing my videos and want to create and share them on my phones. I personally enjoy the cool lens flares that are created by the Moment anamorphic lens when there are lights in the frame and have some ideas about videos I can shoot to share with family and friends. Filmmakers are sure to be excited about this new anamorphic lens and if the  	Kickstarter campaign is any indication of popularity then this may be tough to purchase any time soon. Moment raised nearly $1.6 million with this campaign with thousands of backers. Previous and related coverage: Want a new iPhone or Android smartphone?

ZDNet,New iPhones don't support Apple Pencil: Samsung Note 9 still best for stylus users,09/13/18,https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-iphones-dont-support-apple-pencil-samsung-note-9-still-best-for-stylus-users/,"top picks The 10 best smartphones of 2018 CES and MWC are over and it's time to clear the dust and see what smartphones are leading the pack this year. Read More The Apple Pencil is an excellent tool for iPad owners and there were rumors that Apple would add Pencil support to the new iPhones. Three new iPhones were announced yesterday, but Apple Pencil support was not one of the new functions. It has been more than a month since I started using the Samsung Galaxy Note 9, see our full review, and the S Pen has been ejected and used multiple times every single day. It is essential to my productivity and I am not sure I can give it up on the Note 9 to go to an iPhone Xs Max. While I was interested in seeing what Apple might have done with the Pencil on an iPhone, the inability to carry the Apple Pencil in the iPhone is a non-starter. This is one failure of the Apple Pencil with the iPad, not to mention with the Pixelbook and Microsoft Surface as well, and having to have a case or some other mechanism to carry around a stylus is not a very effective solution. Many Samsung products provide silos for the stylus and the Galaxy Note 9 sets the bar for functionality. If the stylus is not readily available all of the time, experience indicates it will not become a critical part of the user experience. I've detailed why the S Pen is a differentiator and the many ways it enhances the user experience while improving productivity. Given the usefulness of the Apple Pencil on the iPad, it would have been interesting to see what Apple could have brought to the new iPhone. Given the massive 6.5 inch display of the iPhone Xs Max, it seems to be perfect for stylus use. The stylus may be a relic of a bygone era, but Samsung continues to innovate with it and the new Bluetooth capability takes it to the next level of productivity. The Galaxy Note 9 is currently at the top of our 10 best smartphones list and the S Pen is likely to be a major factor in keeping it there for some time. here's the Samsung Note 9 "
ZDNet,Speck Presidio cases for Samsung Galaxy Note 9: Multi-layer drop protection with no-slip grip,09/13/18,https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/speck-presidio-cases-for-samsung-galaxy-note-9-multi-layer-drop-protection-with-no-slip-grip/,"The Samsung Galaxy Note 9, see our full review, is a fantastic phone for business users and thanks to the S Pen, it is great for use in the field to take handwritten notes during surveys and inspection. It is also a $1,000+ phone so some form of additional protection is warranted and that is where Speck provides some attractive and affordable options. The Presidio Grip arrived in Microchip Gray and Ballpoint Blue, along with the Presidio Stay Clear for a couple weeks of testing. I've used the Presidio Grip cases in the past and love the additional no-slip raised rubber texture added to these cases. "
Android Police,The $799 Pixel 3 and $899 Pixel 3 XL are official,10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/799-pixel-3-899-pixel-3-xl-official/,"  It's safe to say that none of Google's products have been spoiled like the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL. Beyond the usual press renders and wild sightings, a number of stolen Pixel 3 XL units ended up in the hands of bloggers. There was almost nothing left to the imagination by the time Google officially showed off the pair of phones, but that time has finally come.  Left: Pixel 3 XL, Right: Pixel 3 Despite the many wishes for notch-less 'Pixel Ultra,' the Pixel 3 XL is exactly what everyone expected. It's equipped with a Snapdragon 845 processor, 4GB of RAM, and a 6.3-inch 2960x1440 OLED screen. The large notch on the front contains two 8MP front-facing cameras, one of which can be used for wide-angle selfies.  Google is still going with a single rear camera, at a resolution of 12.2MP. The Pixel 3 XL also supports wireless charging, something that has been missing from Google's phones since the Nexus 5X/6P. The back panel is a soft-touch glass, and Google says the speakers are 40% louder than the Pixel 2's. The smaller Pixel has a slightly different design, with uniform bezels instead of a display notch. It has the same internal hardware, camera setup, and wireless charging support. The main difference is that it uses a smaller 5.5-inch 1080p display. Both phones will be available in three colors - Clearly White, Just Black, and Not Pink. According to the Project Fi website, pricing starts at $799 for the smaller Pixel, and $899 for the Pixel XL."
Android Police,The Pixel Launcher from the Pixel 3 brings the Assistant button back [APK Download],10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/pixel-launcher-pixel-3-brings-assistant-button-back-apk-download/,"  In Android P DP5, Google took the voice icon that launched Assistant for some inexplicable reason. However, in numerous Pixel 3 leaks, we saw a new Assistant button in its place. Now that the Pixel 3 is in our hands, we're able to grab the APK and bring that button back to all of you.   Left: Android P DP4. Middle: Android P DP5. Right: Pixel 3 launcher. Thus far, the changes we've found in the Pixel 3's Pixel Launcher have been minimal. The Assistant icon has also been added to the app drawer's G pill, which should come in handy. The only other real difference is that adaptive icons are now forced on all icons, so a completely uniform look is now possible even with older and no longer updated apps. That's also why the weather icon has gotten a dinner plate behind it. If you're interested, we have Pixel Launcher v9-4902955 over on APK Mirror ready for download. Let us know if you spot anything else that's new. "
Android Police,Google confirms gesture navigation is mandatory on the Pixel 3,10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/google-confirms-gesture-navigation-mandatory-pixel-3/,"  One of the new features in Android 9 Pie is gesture navigation - the three software nav buttons introduced in Android 4.0 have been replaced by a 'pill' that you swipe back and forth. The new navigation method is optional on the Pixel and Pixel 2, but Google has now confirmed that Pixel 3 owners are stuck with it. In the below tweet, a Google representative confirmed that gesture navigation on the Pixel 3 cannot be disabled. ""Pixel 3 introduces a new pattern that will represent navigation on all Android phones going forward, the tweet said. ""While change & adapting to new patterns is hard, we believe it's a better navigation pattern & makes app switching a faster experience."" Hi! Pixel 3 introduces a new pattern that will represent navigation on all Android phones going forward. While change & adapting to new patterns is hard, we believe it's a better navigation pattern & makes app switching a faster experience. — Made by Google (@madebygoogle) October 9, 2018  This was already expected, especially since gesture navigation is enabled by default on new phones with Pie. Still, if you were hoping to use the classic nav buttons on your Pixel 3, this might be a bit disappointing."

Android Police,Google Clock v6.0 brings several visual tweaks and prepares for the Pixel Stand's sunrise effect [APK Teardown],10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/google-clock-v6-0-brings-several-visual-tweaks-prepares-pixel-stands-sunrise-effect-apk-teardown/," Article Contents  Some of the updates seeping out from the Pixel 3 have been pretty innocuous while others are quite significant. The Clock update leans toward the innocuous side as it brings some subtle but pleasing visual changes to its interface. A teardown also turns up part of the sunrise feature that was announced earlier today.  Unofficial Changelog (the stuff we found):  Left: v5.4. Right: v6.0. The theme for this update is focused almost entirely on blue colors and rounded fonts. Specifically, some things that used to be white (or more of a soft gray) have turned blue, and all of the text is now printed in a much nicer Product Sans, which has been making the rounds lately. Most of the screens have been given at least a little bit of unique attention, too; although the Timer tab is very nearly indistinguishable from its previous version. The Clock tab above has switched to a different version of the globe icon, and you can see hollow outlined icons for controls have been substituted for filled icons in the Alarm tab.  Left: v5.4. Right: v6.0. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the APK. All screenshots and images are real unless otherwise stated, and images are only altered to remove personal information. If you were watching today's presentation by Google, you may have caught the part about the Pixel Stand offering an alarm effect that imitates a morning sunrise. It should come as little or no surprise that the Google Clock app is home to this, or at least part of it. There's not really much new to say here, but the text does include both a button for stopping the sunrise effect and some of the messages used internally for noting that the alarm was canceled on account of other alarms going off, manually canceling, or undocking the phone. The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK. "
Android Police,Not even the Pixel 3's call screening will save you from the nuisance of spam,10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/not-even-pixel-3s-call-screening-will-save-nuisance-spam/,"  Spam phone calls are the abject worst. As if we didn't have enough already, we are rapidly heading towards a future where more calls are spam than not. It's gotten to the point where I leave my phones on DND most of the time, just looking to avoid the hassle of unsolicited numbers ringing me all day long. With the new Pixel 3 phones, Google's introducing a new call-screening feature for Assistant, promising to never make you talk to a spammer again. And while that may be true, your days of dealing with their interruptions aren't quite over yet. When receiving an incoming call from an unfamiliar number, the Assistant on the Pixel 3 gives users the option to screen the call. Upon activating screening, Assistant will answer the line for you, prompting the caller to briefly identify themselves and describe the purpose for the call. All this takes place right on your Pixel 3 itself — not in the cloud — and you see the response immediately thanks to voice-to-text processing. If you're clearly dealing with a spam caller, there's a nice big ""Report as spam"" button you can tap, dismissing the caller while Assistant (somewhat gently) tells them to f-off. That's the end of things, right? Spamming jerk identified, call intercepted, marked, and dealt with. Well, ideally, but with this screening Google's erring on the side of caution.  A previously-flagged spammer trying again (left), requesting more info from a caller (right) Even after marking a caller as spam, you'll still get an alert when they call back — and spammers can be a particularly tenacious bunch. On the plus side, now you get a big, impossible-to-miss warning that it's a suspected spammer on the other end of the line. But you've still got to manually dismiss the call (or just ignore it) — the Pixel won't suppress the call altogether. I can understand why Google's going this route — it's entirely possible you miscategorized a call as spam on first pass, whether due to not quite understanding why they were calling, or something as simple as hitting the ""spam"" button by mistake. And if that call was legitimately important, you'd want a second chance to evaluate the caller's worth. But at the same time, this doesn't solve the annoyance of screening spam calls in the first place — and whether it's you or the Assistant doing the talking, this is still a problem consuming your attention and interrupting your day. It's a nice step in the right direction, but far from the silver bullet that will end the scourge of spam calls for good."
Android Police,The Asus ROG Phone launches in the US October 18th for $899,10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/asus-rog-phone-launches-us-october-18th-899/,"  Asus has been making Republic of Gamers (ROG) products for years, but they've mostly been in the PC gaming realm. Now, ROG is a phone brand, too. The previously announced ROG Phone is about to reach US consumers. It's coming October 18th, but it won't be cheap. Asus wants $899 for the phone, and that's without the fancy gaming accessories.  The ROG Phone has high-end specs like all the supposed ""gaming phones,"" but it also includes a few features that could actually make it better for playing games. Here's the spec sheet. The ROG Phone includes two USB-C ports, one on the bottom and one on the side. The idea is that side port is better for charging and connecting accessories while playing games. There are also two ultrasonic buttons on the top edge, allowing you to map on-screen game functions to the physical controls.  The phone has an active cooling bracket that plugs into that side port, which is silly. Although, it adds a 3.5mm headphone jack and another Type-C port. That's less silly. Asus also has a raft of other accessories for the phone including a $90 controller, a $230 desktop dock, and a $400 ""TwinView"" dock with a secondary screen. Check the PR below for the full list of accessories, but some won't launch until later this year.  The ROG Phone will go on sale at the ASUS Store, Amazon, and Microsoft later this month. The 128GB goes for $899 and the 512GB model will be $1,099. ASUS Republic of Gamers to Launch ROG Phone in the United States on October 18th Fremont, California (October 9, 2018) — ASUS Republic of Gamers (ROG) today announces launch details for the ROG Phone, a game-changing 6-inch smartphone designed specifically for high-performance mobile gaming. The ROG Phone will be available for pre-order on October 18th, during a launch event at the Microsoft Store on Fifth Avenue in New York City. Attendees will be able to learn all about the new ROG Phone, pre-order one in-store, take part in a unique ROG Phone mobile challenge, and join teams to game with special guests Nick Eh 30 and Landon. The phone will be available for pre-order online at the ASUS Store, Amazon, and Microsoft, as well as in-store during the launch event, and will be available for the starting price of $899 USD. The full range of accessories available for the phone will also be available starting in Q4. ROG Phone With pure ROG gaming DNA at its core, and powered by the world's fastest speed-binned 2.96GHz octa-core Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ 845 Mobile Platform with gaming-optimized Qualcomm® Adreno™ 630 GPU, the ROG Phone breaks every rule to go where rivals fear to tread. The ROG phone will be available with two different storage configurations; a 128GB and 512GB version. ROG Phone is built to win: its unique GameCool vapor-chamber cooling system — with detachable AeroActive Cooler for an extra cooling boost — sustains blur-free high frame rates in the heat of battle, while its no-compromise AMOLED display blends a blazing 90Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time with gorgeous HDR visuals. The ultra-comfortable design of ROG Phone includes unique side-mounted ports, and the enhanced, ultra-responsive game controls — including two programmable ultrasonic AirTriggers and advanced force-feedback haptics — let gamers focus all their skills on the game, giving them the edge they need for total domination. ROG Phone Accessories The Mobile Desktop Dock will be priced at $229.99 USD, and allows gamers to connect ROG Phone to an external 4K UHD monitor, mouse and keyboard. ROG Phone can be used as an auxiliary display, hooked up to a wired gigabit LAN and drive a 5.1-channel surround-sound system via the SP/DIF output. A convenient mobile and desktop switch allows users to seamlessly transition from their phone to their desktop or gaming laptop, without having to adjust their current setup. The TwinView Dock, available for $399.99 USD, turns ROG Phone into a powerful dual-screen console for the ultimate gaming and live-streaming experience, or to allow for simultaneous viewing of a game map and gameplay at the same time - on supported games. As well as a 6-inch AMOLED (2160 x 1080) auxiliary screen that's great for split-screen live-streaming, extended game display or group communication, it packs a front-facing quad-speaker system, two extra physical trigger buttons, dual-haptic force-feedback engine, an enhanced cooling system and a high-capacity 6000mAh extended battery pack. With the Gamevice Controller and the WiGig Dock — using 60GHz 802.11ad Wi-Fi — ROG Phone morphs into a portable console, supplying a living room experience, with a full inventory of physical gaming controls and ultra-low-latency wireless display connectivity for a seamless big-screen gaming experience that's perfect for group viewing. The Gamevice Controller can be purchased separately, at $89.99 USD, and packs dual analog joysticks, left and right fire triggers and bumpers, a D-pad, along with A,B,X,Y and L3, R3 buttons. The WiGig Dock will be available for purchase for $329.99 USD. With the ASUS Professional Dock, users can connect their smartphone to a big-screen TV or monitor for a cinematic gaming experience. There's also a network port for fast, stable wired internet connections. The Gigabit Ethernet port lets users enjoy fast and stable wired network connections, while the USB ports allow users to connect a mouse and keyboard for a more comfortable gaming experience. The ASUS Professional Dock is available for $199.99 USD. The ROG Phone Case is designed to provide premium protection for the ROG Phone, keeping it safe from everyday scratches, knocks and bumps. It protects the entire phone, without hindering charging or access to the exclusive AirTriggers. The ROG Phone Case is available for $59.99 USD."
Android Police,Google's Pixel 3 has plenty of new and upcoming camera features,10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/googles-pixel-3-plenty-new-upcoming-camera-features/," Article Contents  The biggest advantage of Pixel ownership, outside Google's highly optimized software experience, is the camera. Pixels have been consistently near or at the top of the pack when it comes to photo quality, and in no small part that's because of that Google software. A camera is more than just hardware, image processing can be as (or more) important than simply having a good sensor, and Google has included plenty of camera improvements this year. Let's take a look.    Google's new Night Sight low-light mode delivered stunning performance in the examples we were shown. With a flick of a software switch, a photo taken in camera-defying darkness became almost literally as clear as day. Details were sparse, and we weren't given a technical explanation for exactly how Night Sight works, but the results speak for themselves. Even the iPhone Xs in the examples provided couldn't hold a metaphorical candle to the Pixel 3's low-light performance via this new mode. What we do know is that Night Sight will be a manual setting, and it isn't available yet. If all goes well, we should have it next month.  Google's new Top Shot mode promises the ability to select the best photo from a series after the fact. So rather than settling for ""good enough"" when you're a split-second too early or too late, you can still get a decent shot — albeit one at a slightly reduced quality. Top Shot even recommends a picture for you, if it thinks it captured a better one, thanks to the perpetual magic of machine learning. So if it notices open eyes or a blur resolving into sharpness, it'll recommend one of those photos. Top Shot is an extension of the same tech that produced Google's Motion Photos. In our own testing, not all the Top Shot photos were HDR, and one of Google's camera engineers told us the alternative photos in the series were lower resolution. So while it's still best to get the photo right the first time, at least you won't miss out a decent image if you're a bit off.  Rather than bundle an expensive secondary telephoto camera in the Pixel 3, Google was able to mimic a similar effect for zoom in photos it calls Super Res Zoom. Based on the description we were given by an engineer at Google, we think it's based on an astrophysics imaging technique that combines multiple short exposures for increased sharpness of sub-pixel interpolation — sort of like HDR, but for resolving fine details, rather than dynamic range. It probably can't equal the actual quality of a dedicated zoom lens, but it's certainly better than nothing, and Google has some of the best software zoom around. Remember AR Stickers? Well, now it's called Playground, giving you the same sort of augmented reality fun in your Pixel's camera. That's... pretty much it.  We're all pretty familiar with Google Lens at this point. At least, you should be if you haven't been living under a rock. The very short version is that Google Lens is a tool that allows you to search for additional information on the things you point your camera at. Now Lens is coming to the Pixel 3 for limited offline use, allowing you to quickly pull info like phone numbers or QR codes without having to send off to Google's servers for processing. It's is more of a minor feature, but the new Photobooth mode allows you to automatically capture photos when the on-device AI recognizes you might want to. So if you make a funny face with your friends or crack a smile for a selfie, you don't need to risk shaking the camera to snap a photo — it's all automatic.  This was easily one of the most impressive things we played with in our time with the Pixel 3. Motion Auto Focus allows you to lock the Pixel 3's camera onto something in the scene, and it will follow that object in focus and exposure. Whether that's a dog that can't hold still or a car that's driving by, it's one less thing to manage, letting you pay attention to details like composition and timing.  We finally know what that 2nd front-facing camera is. Google saw fit to equip the Pixel 3 with a wide-angle selfie camera, sporting an expanded 97-degree FoV. So the next time you get the urge to pull out a selfie stick, instead you can just tweak a slider to fit.  Google started preparing for its own adjustable Bokeh effect as early as June, and it appears to have been delivered on the Pixel 3. Like Samsung and Apple, now you can adjust how far in or out of focus the other parts of a ""Portrait"" mode photo are. In fact, you can even change which part of the image is in focus after you capture it. While I doubt that means it can fix something which was blurry or outside the focal plane to begin with, you can at least fine tune what the additional Portrait mode effect selects. Some of these features should make it to older Pixel devices like the Pixel 2 as well. We can confirm that sideloading the latest version of the Google Camera app, together with a recent version of the Google Photos app, gives older devices the adjustable bokeh effect. While some of the new features may be tied to improved hardware in the Pixel 3, at least a few should trickle down — if not officially, then at a minimum via modified versions of the Google Camera app."
Android Police,Google now offers smart home product bundles at a discount,10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/google-now-offers-smart-home-product-bundles-discount/,"  If you're looking to deck your house out in connected devices, Google has you covered. The 'Smart TV kit' with a Home Mini and Chromecast leaked last week, and now it appears that's just one of several bundles that Google now sells on its website. As you might expect, each bundle is less expensive than buying the products separately. Here's everything that is currently listed on the Google Store: That's a lot of bundles. It's not clear which of these will be sold through other retail stores, but I'd expect Best Buy to stock at least some of them."
Android Police,Driving Mode on the Pixel 3 can automatically turn on Android Auto,10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/driving-mode-pixel-3-can-automatically-turn-android-auto/,"  It's no secret that driving and cellphones don't mix. On the Pixel 2, users can create a rule for automatically engaging Do Not Disturb. On the Pixel 3, there's a new option to open Android Auto automatically with Driving Mode. Available exclusively on the Pixel 3 lineup, Driving Mode gives the familiar option for turning on Do Not Disturb, but also the new ability to 'Open Android Auto.' Using the latter, users can choose how they would like the phone to decide when to engage the car system – either when the device connects to Bluetooth or when driving is detected based on traveling speed.

Android Police,"Xiaomi announces $60 Mi Box S with Android TV 8.1, now available for pre-order",10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/xiaomi-announces-60-mi-box-s-android-tv-8-1-now-available-pre-order/,"  While Google was busy announcing new phones, tablets, and other gadgets, Xiaomi unveiled its new Android TV box. The Mi Box 4 and 4c launched in China earlier this year, and now the company has announced an international version with Android TV - the Mi Box S. The set-top box runs Android TV 8.1, so it has the new channel-based launcher that came in Oreo. It supports video playback up to 4K 60FPS, with HDR and Dolby/DTS Audio to boot. The included remote has a voice search button, so you can ask Google Assistant questions without shouting across the room. As far as hardware, the Mi Box S has an unspecified Cortex A53-based processor, a Mali 450 GPU, 2GB of DDR3 memory, 8GB of internal storage, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi (2.4/5GHz), and Bluetooth 4.2. If you need more storage, there's a single USB 2.0 port on the back. The Mi Box S can be pre-ordered from Walmart for $59.99. The current estimated shipping date is November 3. Now that Google doesn't have any first-party Android TV boxes, it's nice to see Xiaomi step in with an affordable option."
Android Police,"Pixel Slate impressions: Android tablets are dead, long live Chromebooks",10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/pixel-slate-impressions-android-tablets-dead-long-live-chromebooks/,"  At today's Made by Google event, we finally got a look at the much-leaked Pixel Slate. It's Google's first attempt at bringing Chrome OS to a ""tablet first"" form-factor. The Pixel Slate is a decidedly premium effort, with a high resolution ""Molecular Display,"" 8th gen Intel CPUs, and stylish metal design — paired with an appropriate $600-$1600 price tag. It might be on the expensive side, but since Google is transitioning its own tablet efforts to Chrome OS, I think it's safe to say the end of Android tablets is nigh.  We only got to spend a bit of time playing with the Pixel Slate today, and while it's too early to make any final determinations, our initial impressions were positive. Physically, the device is incredibly thin, but its metal construction feels solid and durable. At 12.3"" the obvious comparison is Apple's 12.9"" iPad Pro, and the Pixel Slate's display beats it on a few specs, like overall resolution and PPI — though the iPad Pro hits a substantially higher brightness at around 600 nits (depending on who you ask), compared to the Pixel Slate's slightly more pedestrian 400.  The Pixel Imprint combo fingerprint sensor/power button is nicely positioned at a slight cutout near the corner of one of the long edges — expect more on how it actually performs in our future review. Interestingly, Google seems to have placed a greater focus when it comes to hardware on the tablets' front-facing camera. Although it's a mere 8Mp, the sensor has chunky 1.4μm pixels. Combined with Google's well-known software camera chops, the Pixel Slate should have excellent performance even in mediocre lighting the next time you call someone up via Duo or do a group Hangout.  Although it isn't included with your base purchase, the Pixel Slate's $200 keyboard will likely be a popular choice. Unlike the HP Chromebook X2, the keyboard isn't included, you have to purchase it separately. That distinction is telling: Google doesn't believe that the keyboard is necessary to use the Pixel Slate. It's a Tablet, with a capital ""T."" Google claims the keyboard is designed to be as nice to use as the much-loved Pixelbook's, and while I don't quite agree with that claim, it's not bad. Key travel was OKish, and though the shape of the keys was a bit difficult to use blind, I was able to get up near my max typing speed at an adjusted 111 WPM, down from ~120. That didn't stop it from being the single ugliest keyboard I've ever used, though. The keyboard cover accessory connects to the Pixel Slate magnetically, powered by a set of four pogo pins. It's also a nearly free-form stand, allowing you to set the Pixel Slate at pretty much any angle within its slightly limited range. It doesn't offer quite the freedom in that regard that a laptop might, but there's a lot of flexibility.  As a tablet, the hardware is important, but a lot of responsibility for how the Pixel Slate will perform rests on the shoulders of Chrome OS. We're told the Pixel Slate will have a new version of the Assistant that is entirely native, rather than running inside Android. Furthermore, the Slate's included Android framework is based on Android Pie out of the box. (As an aside, we're told Google hopes to bring Pie to the Pixelbook in the future as well, perhaps as soon as the end of the year, but no guarantees.) It could be a result of preproduction software given the Slate isn't actually shipping yet, but we found it was a bit slower to launch apps or open settings dialogues than we expected. Visually, the Pixel Slate has the same look that the Pixelbook gets on the current Beta/Dev channels with the centered icons in the taskbar and the new touch-optimized app launcher, and it's a good look.  Presumably, the Pixel Slate has the same (or better) level of Android app compatibility that the current Pixelbook enjoys, simply packaged in a new, touch-first form factor. That gives it all of the advantages of Android apps, minus a few things like a real Android home screen/launcher, but with the added benefit of Chrome OS and a full desktop-style browser. In my opinion, the loss of the traditional Android accouterments is a small price to pay for the benefits provided by Chrome OS. Google's browser-centric environment may not beat a full PC for some productive workflows, but for many of us, it's more than enough to do real work, especially with the addition of Linux app support (though I still want virtual desktops). Mix in Android apps for play and entertainment, and the Pixel Slate could be a serious contender for the working professional, serving some of the same audience that devices like Apple's iPad Pro and Microsoft's Surface tablets. In a genuinely unique way, the Pixel Slate approaches the tablet problem from both sides simultaneously, giving you that desktop-first Chrome OS environment together with the support of mobile-first apps. In concept, that seems like best of both worlds, rather than simply the extension of one into the other. We'll have to wait and see how it performs in our full review, but I'm cautiously optimistic for the Pixel Slate. The Pixel Slate is certainly expensive at $600 for the base SKU, but this is the first-party, high-end herald of a coming era: Android tablets are dead, long live Chromebooks. "
Android Police,Brydge's G-Type keyboard will make the Pixel Slate more of a conventional laptop,10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/brydges-g-type-keyboard-will-make-pixel-slate-conventional-laptop/,"    Alongside the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL, the Pixel Slate was announced today. It's a big, expensive, 12-inch tablet with an optional first-party keyboard cover that turns it into a sort of half-measure laptop. For those seeking a more traditional computing experience (but not enough so to buy a traditional computer), Brydge has a product that may interest you: the G-Type keyboard.    The G-Type is a full-size backlit keyboard/track pad combo that snaps onto the bottom of the Slate. It matches the tablet's color, and it can fold shut like a regular ol' laptop. It's got all the right keys, including one for the Google Assistant — and they're square, which is sure to please a lot of people. It connects to the Slate by Bluetooth and charges with USB-C; Brydge says the battery can last up to six months on a full charge. Another compelling detail is the price: at $159.99, the G-Type is 40 bucks cheaper than Google's own offering. You can read more about the keyboard and join a waitlist to order at Brydge's website.

Android Police,Pixel 2 XL drops to $699 on the Google Store,10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/pixel-2-xl-drops-699-google-store/,"  As is customary when a new Pixel phone debuts, Google has dropped the price of the older model on the Google Store. The Pixel 2 XL now costs $699, a $150 discount when compared to its original MSRP of $849. Oddly, the Pixel 2 hasn't been discounted at all, meaning it's now just $50 less than its larger brother.   Of course, $699 is a pretty terrible deal for a year-old Pixel phone, and the 2 XL can be found on Swappa in great condition for around $450-500. It's also over double what Google is offering for Pixel 2 XL trade-ins. But if you really have to have a brand-new Pixel 2 XL right now, this is an option available to you."
Android Police,"The Pixel 3's Google Camera brings a new UI, RAW support, and a new panorama mode [APK Download]",10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/pixel-3s-google-camera-brings-new-ui-raw-support-new-panorama-mode-apk-download/,"  The Pixel 3 has finally been officially announced, which means that new APKs are starting to roll in. We're kicking things off with the new Google Camera, which sports a number of differences from the current app on Pixels and Pixel 2s. Highlights include an updated interface, RAW support (finally), and a new panorama mode.   Left: Old. Right: New. The first thing that you'll notice when opening the Pixel 3 camera is the different interface. The smaller video button besides the capture button is gone, and Google has added an Apple-esque carousel above for switching to different modes. Thankfully, the dated hamburger menu is gone, and the carousel now also includes Panorama and Portrait. Other modes and settings are now found in a tab on the right called 'More.' There's also now a new zoom UI, a white ring around your photos, and the color temperature icon has been tweaked.  Left: Old. Right: New. The settings look the same until you dig around a bit. Something that was mysteriously omitted in the first place, RAW support, is now present under the 'Advanced' section. There's also a direct link to RAW images there. Once the RAW toggle is turned on, a quick setting on the top of the viewfinder allows you to switch between JPEG only and RAW+JPEG. Additionally, the Burst settings are gone now, which makes sense given that it didn't really need to be there - Photos already did the same thing.  The new panorama mode. Google has also updated the panorama mode. Gone are the dots you had to align; the new version is easier to use. Google tells us it has better stitching quality, and panoramas are now optimized for VR viewing as well. Portrait mode also has a new face retouching option   Left: Old. Right: New. Hidden away in Portrait mode on the Pixel 2 is a new option for face retouching. Instead of just turning it on or off, there are now two different levels it can be set to: Natural or Soft. Panoramas can now record sound; just hit the little mic icon on the top left to turn that on/off. The focus slider for portrait photos replaces the pop slider, which has been relocated to a tile. The viewfinder can also be long-pressed to enter Lens mode. Google stuffed a lot of changes into this update. If you'd like to check the Pixel 3's camera out, you're in luck; we've got Google Camera v6.1 on APK Mirror available for download right now. Note that a minimum of Android 9 Pie is required, and that Live Lens, H265, live focus tracking, and Top Shot won't be added with this APK; they'll remain Pixel 3 exclusives. Night Sight isn't currently live, but it'll arrive next month, according to Google. "
Android Police,Mickey Mouse Home Mini base from OtterBox coming soon to the Google Store,10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/mickey-mouse-home-mini-base-otterbox-coming-soon-google-store/,"  Smart home devices no longer have to look stale, thanks to a Google partnership with Disney and OtterBox. The Google Store will soon sell a kid-friendly Mickey Mouse base for its Home Mini device. The company handed the accessory out to attendees at the company’s Made by Google event, but for those not there, it will retail for $19.95 in the U.S.  The Mickey Mouse addition is a creative way to make children more comfortable with using Google Assistant. Rather than conversing with a nondescript box, it will have a bit of personality to it. The base is part of OtterBox’s Den Series of accessories for Home devices and was made to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the world’s favorite mouse. There’s no word yet on official availability; the page on the Google Store simply lists it as ""coming soon."""
Android Police,"Pixel 3 first impressions: Probably the best ""small"" smartphone in years",10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/pixel-3-first-impressions-probably-best-small-smartphone-years/,"  The first Google Pixel - the small one - was basically a downsized carbon copy of its larger sibling. Price aside, it was what phone enthusiasts had been demanding from Google for years - a smaller smartphone that wasn't compromised relative to the bigger device that came alongside it. With the Pixel 2, that formula changed, and we got a phone with an older display layout, inferior haptics, and build quality that seemed a little ""lesser than"" the truly premium 2 XL. While the bigger phone had its issues, it was the little things that made the Pixel 2 just that much less special, less modern. With the Pixel 3, it's a return to form: the smaller phone looks the part of a premium handset and really does just feel like a baby 3 XL. Naturally, the battery is smaller, and the display is a full HD 18:9 panel (a much nicer one) rather than the XL's denser quad HD, but no one's going to notice that. The lack of a display notch is probably preferable for most people, and the addition of wireless charging, dual front-facing cameras, improved front-facing speakers, along with a suite of new camera features bespoke the Pixel 3 make this a meaningful upgrade over last year's phone.  The sticking point, of course, is the price. At $800, the Pixel 3 sits a full $180 above an unlocked Galaxy S9 here in the US, and I won't lie to you: that's just too much money. Google has jumped the proverbial shark on pricing this year, and I think it's going to bite them harder than they expect. Samsung has aggressively priced its phones through discounting over the course of 2018, and both of the new Pixels are asking far too much money relative to the Galaxy S9 and S9+. But, that's not to say you aren't getting anything for the extra money. The latest and greatest Android, a complete and utter lack of bloatware, and what are very likely to be the best-ever cameras on a smartphone aren't trivial things. For a ""money is no object"" customer, the Pixels will provide the best Android smartphone experience you can buy, and probably the best mobile imaging you can buy period. But getting back to the small Pixel, I'm finding I really like the size of this phone. It's a hair narrower than the Pixel 2, but manages to pack in substantially more screen thanks to the wide aspect ratio. The camera launches amazingly quickly, the phone is exceptionally fast, and the screen is wonderful.  I'm also loving the improved haptic feedback on the Pixel 3, which is even better than it was on my 2 XL. The Pixel 2 was saddled with an inferior vibration motor last year, but now it feels essentially on par with the one in the 3 XL by my initial judgment. The motor clicks and and jolts in a way that, while not as good as the iPhone's taptic engine, is far better than what you get in any other Android smartphone (aside from, perhaps, LG's V40). So far, my impressions of the Pixel 3 are quite good, putting the price aside. This is a truly premium smartphone at a size most anyone can manage. But bringing money into the picture makes this a much harder call. Are Google's phones really worth their increasingly substantial premium? That, I think, comes down to your individual demands. And it's a question I won't be able to answer fully until spending more time with this phone. "
Android Police,Google offering select customers $50 store credit with Pixel 3 pre-order,10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/google-offering-select-customers-50-store-credit-pixel-3-pre-order/,"   With the Pixel event wrapped up, many eager customers are likely scoping out the best place to pre-order. For some U.S. customers, ordering from Google directly might be the best option. The company is now offering a $50 Google Store credit to people who signed up for Pixel marketing emails.  The offer is valid until October 18th, when the first devices begin to ship. After a qualifying order ships, customers will be notified of the credit within 4 - 6 weeks. In order for this promotion to work, you must checkout while logged into the Google Account which received the email. Returning the device also nullifies the offer."
Android Police,DisplayMate says the Pixel 3 XL display gets an 'A+ Rating',10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/displaymate-says-pixel-3-xl-display-gets-rating/,"  Last year, Google caught flack for equipping the Pixel 2 XL with one of LG's new mobile OLED panels. While the display wasn't bad in my estimation, it definitely was not as good as the panels on other phones in the same price range. Even the first-gen Pixels looked better. If you place any faith in DisplayMate, the Pixel 3 XL will be much improved.  DisplayMate didn't test the Pixel 2 XL last year, but the issues with the display were well-known. It had blue color casting at off-angles, the colors were a bit off, and the ""purple smear"" effect was more obvious than other screens. Google seems to have gone out of its way to send DisplayMate an early unit so it could test the display. DisplayMate has Lab Tested the Google Pixel 3 XL OLED Display which has earned our Highest A+ Rating and a DisplayMate Best Smartphone Display Award. Our in-depth Display Shoot-Out review article will go live here on Monday October 15. — DisplayMate Tech (@DisplayMate) October 9, 2018  So, this doesn't tell us much other than DisplayMate likes the display. The iPhone X also won the ""DisplayMate Best Smartphone Display Award."" The site regularly gushes about Samsung's OLEDs, but it doesn't test all phones. The Pixel 2 XL had an LG OLED panel, but we don't know about the 3XL. It may be another LG part, though. Based on David's time with the V40, LG's OLED quality is much improved this year. DisplayMate will have a full analysis on October 15th, which will hopefully include comparisons with Samsung's latest screens."
Android Police,Pixel Stand impressions: Google's renewed interest in wireless charging delivers a clever surprise,10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/pixel-stand-impressions-googles-renewed-interest-wireless-charging-delivers-clever-surprise/,"  It's been a minute since Google offered support for wireless charging on any of its smartphones, last making the feature available on the Nexus 6. And while it remained on the sidelines for the first and second-gen Pixels, with today's launch of the Pixel 3 it's finally back — and dare I say, thanks to the Pixel Stand, better than ever. Honestly, simply having support for wireless charging return would make me plenty happy. I don't use the feature all the time, but it really is convenient having a charging pad sitting on my desk, ready to top-off the charge of whatever compatible phone I plop down on it. And if Google just gave us a regular ""dumb"" wireless charger, that would be fine. It wouldn't be worth the $80 Google's charging for the Pixel Stand, but at the right price it could still be a perfectly satisfactory accessory. But that's not what Google's doing here, not at all. It's far too easy to throw around the ""smart"" moniker when introducing new tech, but thanks to one neat trick the Pixel Stand is probably one of the most clever wireless chargers around. Key to the Stand's functionality is the way it transforms your phone's UI. Rather than just charge the Pixel 3 when it's set in place, the Stand triggers access to a series of features that turn the phone into something along the lines of a smart display — you get easy access to Assistant, the ability to view Google Photos albums as slideshows, and smart-home integration with things like your Nest Hello doorbell cam.  The Pixel Stand all by its lonesome (left), Nest Hello announcing a handsome gentleman (right) All that's great, but for me the magic is in how the Pixel 3 is able to recognize not just the Pixel Stand itself, but tell the difference between specific units. Having Assistant remind you about your schedule is nice at home, but maybe you'd prefer not to have all that info popping up when powering the phone on a generic Qi charger in a public space. Or maybe you'd love Photos to display pics of your family when charging with the Pixel Stand on your bedside table, but not when docked on the Stand you keep in your office. How can the Pixel 3 tell these use cases apart? Google has cooked up its own solution, embedding a special data stream within the wireless charging signal.  It's not NFC or Bluetooth — the Pixel Stand wirelessly communicates with the Pixel 3 through the charging emissions themselves. And that enables users to pair their phone with particular chargers, specifying rules for what content should be available in the process. It's just a small feature — which is why you probably haven't heard about it even if you were watching today's launch event — but one that adds just enough extra polish to help elevate the Pixel Stand above third-party wireless charging stands. Google says that it brought wireless charging back because the tech has finally gotten to a point where speeds are sufficient enough to make wireless a compelling alternative to traditional charging. And while that may be true, leave it to Google to also introduce a whole new feature that none of us were expecting."
Android Police,"Google Lens on Pixel 3 gains deeper camera app integration, offline availability",10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/google-lens-on-pixel-3-gains-deeper-camera-app-integration-offline-availability/,"  One year after the initial release of Google Lens alongside the Pixel 2, Google has integrated the AI-enabled tool directly into the Pixel 3's Google Camera app, and announced that some functions are available while the phone is offline. These changes add utility to the feature, and serve as a visual reminder to use the tool — something that's been lacking up to this point. As the leaks forecasted, Lens Suggestions are built into the Pixel 3's camera directly. All users have to do is open their camera, point in the right direction, and tap to activate various functions — for instance, calling a phone number on a takeout menu. This all happens without having to initially tap on the screen to bring up Lens.  Lens Suggestions in action. Additionally, on the Pixel 3, users can now just long press in the camera app to gain access to the full Lens experience. Users can also pop Lens open in recent apps by swiping up from the home button and long pressing on an image. Accessing Lens from recent apps. But perhaps the most exciting new Lens features is offline availability for Lens Suggestions, using Google's Pixel Visual Core. This means you'll be able to get suggestions to add a contact by pointing your Pixel 3 camera at a business card even while in Airplane Mode or with data switched off, though it won't allow for actions that launch into a Google search or app that requires the internet. These new features will arrive on older Pixels in addition to the newly announced model, apart from Lens Suggestions, which is exclusive to the Pixel 3 due to the fact that it requires hardware integration. Google clarified which features are exclusive to the Pixel 3 (Lens Suggestions), and noted that only Lens Suggestions will be available offline."
Android Police,Call Screen will let Pixel users see who's calling and what they want before answering,10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/call-screen-will-let-pixel-users-see-whos-calling-want-answering/,"  Not everything got leaked before Google's event today. One surprise announcement that wowed was Call Screen, a new feature that lets the Google Assistant answer your incoming calls and politely ask what the caller wants. A real-time transcript will appear on your screen, allowing you to decide whether or not you want to pick up.   When your Pixel rings, a ""Screen call"" button shows up alongside the usual controls. Tapping it will prompt the Google Assistant to tell your caller that the call is being screened and ask what it's about. Their explanation is transcribed on your screen, and you have options to mark the call as spam or tell the caller you'll get back to them, among others.  The feature seems well suited for handling calls from numbers you aren't familiar with, but it could also be useful for seeing if a caller you know needs something important when you're in a situation where you can't talk. Call Screen will launch with the Pixel 3, and older Pixel phones will start seeing the feature as early as next month."
Android Police,"Moment Photo cases are now available for the Pixel 3, Moment Pro app offers 20% discount (3 days only)",10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/moment-photo-cases-now-available-pixel-3-moment-pro-app-offers-20-discount-3-days/,"  Google just finished announcing the new Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL, the latest generation in a line of phones known for exceptional camera performance.

They're available in Black, Walnut, and an all new Tan Leather option made from speckled white Horween Leather.  Naturally, these cases include a mounting point for Moment's assortment of add-on camera lenses (plus the new anamorphic lens), but this year's model has been enhanced with a fiberglass mount so it's more durable than ever. The structure has also been redesigned for the Pixel 3 to be more resistant to drop sand impacts, plus this version offers a bit more coverage than last year's Pixel 2 cases.

It's a pretty good deal since you'll get the app for just $1.99 (USD) and you will save $7.99 on the cost of a case, plus quite a bit more if you add any lenses, straps, or other accessories to the cart."
Android Police,Moshi Type-C audio and charging adapter now available for $40,10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/moshi-type-c-audio-charging-adapter-now-available-40/,"  The loss of the headphone jack on the Pixel lineup meant there was no way to use wired headphones and charge your phone at the same time. While there are plenty of goofy-looking adapters for the iPhone that give you a headphone jack with power pass-through, no such adapter has been available for Type-C Android phones - at least not any that worked well. Moshi, an accessory company, tried to make one such adapter last year for the Pixel 2. It received poor reviews on Amazon, with many buyers citing issues with audio static and charging speeds, and the Google Store listing was pulled earlier this year. Moshi is now back with a second-generation adapter, which is already available from the Google Store and Moshi's website.  The second-generation Type-C/headphone jack adapter The dongle costs $40, and it claims to output high-resolution 24-bit/96 kHz audio from its headphone jack. Moshi says the adapter supports USB-PD 3.0, but a charging speed is not listed. Going by how well the last model worked, I'd wait for reviews before buying one. “A lot of people look at a small adapter like this and think it’s pretty straightforward to make,” said Spencer Pangborn, Director of Product Marketing at Moshi. “But unfortunately that’s not the case. In addition to compatibility across a wide range of USB-C devices, there are many different charging scenarios that must be considered. We worked closely with Google’s engineering team to ensure our adapter meets their compatibility requirements, and as far as I know we’re the first company to launch and certify this type of adapter.” The updated adapter has a new PCB layout to reduce power consumption and new firmware for greater compatibility across devices. It features a built-in digital-to-analog converter (DAC) which outputs high-resolution audio at 24-bit/96 kHz. A Class G amplifier enhances the sound quality of older headphones to improve the listening experience. Made from anodized aluminum for added durability, the USB-C Digital Audio Adapter with Charging retails for $40 and is available today for purchase at www.moshi.com.

Android Police,"Google Home app gets smart home controls, intelligent actions, and household sharing",10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/google-home-app-gets-smart-home-controls-intelligent-actions-household-sharing/,"  The Google Home app has been a mess for a while now. Instead of being a control center for your smart home, as the name suggests, the main focus is video content suggestion - a holdover from when it was the Chromecast app. We first saw evidence that a redesign was in the works a few months ago, and now the new app is official. The main screen now contains a list of your smart home devices, and you can make adjustments without diving into the product's specific application. For example, you can change the thermostat temperature without opening the Nest app, or toggle a light without opening the Hue app.  The new Google Home app (thanks Ben!) Another major improvement is that anyone in your home can control the home's connected devices, regardless of what accounts they are signed in to. If they have the Google Home app, they can turn the lights on or off. No more sitting in a dark room because your roommate/family member can't log in to Hue.  The app also lets you add 'home members,' who will have the ability to control connected devices from outside the local network. ""We also added a feature for those of us who are on call to answer tech questions for our less-savvy family members that lets you control multiple homes,"" Google said in a blog post. ""That means you can manage your parents’ home or help that cousin who’s having trouble setting up their smart home."" The new design appears to be in the early stages of a rollout. We'll update this post with a link to the APK once we get it. "
Android Police,"[Update: More info] Google's AR Stickers app is now Playground, with four new 'Playmoji' packs",10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/googles-ar-stickers-app-now-playground-four-new-playmoji-packs/,"  Ahead of its hardware event today, even Google is leaking its own announcements. Earlier this morning, the company posted a $25 off deal when purchasing a Chromecast Ultra and not-yet-announced Google Home Hub. Now, it's posted to the Play Store four new AR ""Playmoji"" packs for its newly-renamed Playground app, none of which can currently be downloaded.  Playground, formerly AR Stickers, is an app that allows users with compatible phones to add three-dimensional augmented reality ""stickers"" to their camera views, taking photos and videos of the characters. Stickers and Playmoji seem to be two different things, judging by screenshots from Playground's new Play Store listing, but all existing stickers look to have been renamed Playmoji. With the re-brand, all Playmoji packs now have ""Playground"" affixed to their Play Store titles, making them easier to spot. Left: Pets. Right: Signs. The new packs added today include a set of dog Playmoji called Pets, some funky arrows called Signs, claymation-style human characters in Sports, and cute little weather-themed dudes in a pack called Weather. They all show as being incompatible with current Pixel devices, so the new Playmoji may end up being Pixel 3-exclusive. Left: Sports. Right: Weather. We'll know all about the new Playground and Playmoji in just a bit. Until then, you can peruse their Play Store listings below. Google has officially unveiled Playground in a blog post that details some of the feature's new additions, including real-time Playmoji suggestions based on the scene you're in and the ability to use the front-facing camera, which Google employee Rajan Patel demonstrated in a tweet. (apologies for the blur, was literally running to school with the kids this morning). — Rajan Patel (@rajanpatel) October 9, 2018  Google also shared a video in its funny new Pixel 3 series about the feature:  Lookin' pretty neat!

Android Police,"Pixel 3 owners get free full-size photo uploads until January 31, 2022",10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/pixel-3-owners-get-free-full-size-photo-uploads-january-31-2022/,"  Free full-resolution photo storage has always been a selling point for Pixel phones. With this year's devices being pricier than ever, that perk is all the more important, and thankfully, it's still here: photos taken on the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL until January 31, 2022 will be stored at full resolution indefinitely.  This isn't a surprise, but it's good to have official confirmation. The free storage period actually extends longer into the Pixel 3's lifespan than the Pixel 2's does — the 2 launched in late 2017 and it gets free storage until the end of 2020, whereas this year's model launches this month and gets free uploads a month into its fifth year of life (if we're counting 2018). Here are the full terms: Photos uploaded before the end of January 2022 will stay at their original size; if you're still using the Pixel 3 in 2022, full-size photos after January will eat into your Google Drive storage."
Android Police,Nest Learning Thermostat now comes in three new finishes,10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/nest-learning-thermostat-now-comes-three-new-finishes/,"  The third-generation Nest Thermostat, officially called the 'Learning Thermostat', has been around since 2015. If you weren't a massive fan of the existing styles, Google announced today that three new finishes will be available - Mirror Black, Brass, and Polished Steel (seen above). The new finishes will be sold alongside the existing Nest Thermostat color options - Black, Copper, Stainless Steel, and White. ""There are now seven color options to choose from in total, Google said in a blog post, ""so you can find the one that matches your personal style best."""
Android Police,"Google's Pixel 3 cases are up for pre-order with new designs, third-party options also available",10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/googles-pixel-3-cases-pre-order-new-designs-third-party-options-also-available/,"  Not only did Google announce the new Pixel Stand to accompany the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL, but the company also updated its line of cases with new designs and customization options. From fresh fabric colors to more My Case (formerly Live Case) choices, these cases are bound to bring some style to your new phone. Oh, and they are Qi compatible and support Active Edge. Both the fabric and My Case custom cases are available now for pre-order on the Google Store. Fabric ones will cost you $40, while My Cases go for $50. No one ever said style would be cheap. Live Cases are now My Cases If you're interested in other stuff, you can also choose from several different accessory manufacturers, like Otterbox, Zagg, and Moment. Here's a full list of Pixel 3 accessories so far:"
Android Police,"Pixel 3 and 3 XL pre-orders, pricing, availability, and more",10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/pixel-3-3-xl-pre-orders-pricing-availability/,"  Google has revealed the Pixel 3 and 3 XL, and I mean for real this time. We saw about a billion leaks as the annual hardware event approached, but now we've got all the details. Google's new Pixel phones are spendy, but you can drop the cash on them right now.   To recap, there was not a secret third Pixel phone this year. The phones that leaked are the phones we got. There's the 5.5-inch Pixel 3 and a 6.3-inch Pixel 3 XL. Here are the specs. The Pixel 3 starts at $799 with 64GB of storage. For double the storage, you'll pay $100 more. The Pixel 3 XL starts at $899 and it's still $100 more for the 128GB upgrade. Yes, these prices are higher than last year. The Pixel 3 is $150 more than the Pixel 2, and the 3 XL is $50 more than the 2 XL. Google offers payment plans, so you can pay as little as $33.29 per month for the Pixel 3 or $37.46 per month for the Pixel 3 XL. Strangely, Verizon charges more for the Pixel 3 XL if purchased directly from the carrier—it's $930 or $38.74 per month. The Pixel 3 and 3 XL will be available officially in 13 countries, including several new ones. Here's the full list.  You can pre-order the Pixel phones today from Verizon, the Google Store, and Project Fi. The Google Store is offering shipping as early as October 19th, but that date will likely move further out as orders pile up. Verizon's pre-orders should ship around the same time, and the phones will be in stores on October 18th. If you pre-order one Verizon Pixel 3 64GB right now (for a limited time), you can get a second one free with a new line of service. Today only, ordering a Pixel 3 via the My Verizon app gets you a free Pixel Stand. Google does not appear to offer any enticements, but the longer you wait, the later that shipping date will be. On Fi, you can get up to $799 in service credits when you buy two Pixels and add a line."
Android Police,Google reveals minor third-generation Chromecast update with multi-room audio support,10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/google-2018-third-generation-chromecast-refresh/,"  Like much of Google's 2018 hardware, the arrival of a refreshed Chromecast was an open secret ahead of October 9th. The full details were hazy, though, leaving Chromecast fans with a little room for excitement. Unfortunately, the full reveal was less intriguing than the already minimal update most were expecting. Though the Chromecast hasn't been refreshed in three years, Google failed to mention the new hardware during its event. Now that the company has quietly added the device to its store, it's clear not much has changed. The $35 dongle does not have Bluetooth support, as an earlier FCC filing seemed to indicate, instead featuring just Wi-Fi 802.11ac. It also features an up to 1080p resolution at 60fps, which is an improvement on the 720p at 60fps streaming support of the previous device (or 1080p at 30fps), but still a little disappointing if you consider that the new Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K and Roku Premiere offer 4K for only marginally higher prices. The new hardware does, however, let users play music in sync with other speakers connected to Google's smart devices, like a Chromecast Audio dongle, but that feature won't launch until later this year. It also supports newly launched Live Albums for Google Photos on your TV. The 2018 Chromecast comes in Chalk and Charcoal, with a new matte finish and minimal Google branding. The device is available from the Google Store starting today in the US, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Great Britain, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, and Sweden, with more countries to follow in 2019."
Android Police,Pixel USB Type-C earbuds now available on the Google Store for $30,10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/pixel-usb-type-c-earbuds-now-available-google-store-30/,"  There were whispers about second-generation wireless Pixel Buds being announced today, but that didn't happen. As previous leaks suggested, the Pixel 3 comes with USB Type-C earbuds, so you aren't limited to using the included headphone jack adapter. If you lose your earbuds or you aren't buying the Pixel 3 at all, you can now get the earbuds separately on the Google Store. The 'Pixel USB-C earbuds' are fairly basic, but they can play ""24-bit digital audio"" and feature adjustable loops (like the wireless Pixel Buds). There's a small control module on the cable, with volume buttons and a center key for launching Google Assistant. The cord is 44 inches (1123 mm) long.  Google says the earbuds should work on any device with USB Type-C, but we all know how finicky and complicated Type-C audio is. You can buy them from the link below."
Android Police,Google Duplex rolls out starting in November on Pixel phones,10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/google-duplex-rolls-starting-next-month-pixel-phones/,"  One of the most impressive (and unsettling) I/O moments happened earlier this year when Google showed off Duplex, an AI chatbot that can place calls for you like a robotic personal assistant. Google wouldn't confirm its plans for Duplex at the time, but it's almost ready for the general public. Duplex is hitting Pixel phones starting next month, but it won't be available everywhere.  The idea behind Duplex is that you don't always want to call a human on the phone to make an appointment or book a reservation. So, Google can call for you and add the information to your calendar. The demo at I/O was suspiciously good, but Google says most Duplex calls work out just fine. You may soon have a chance to test that yourself. Duplex will become part of the Google Assistant experience on Pixel phones later this year, but it's rolling out on a city-by-city basis. The first batch includes New York, Atlanta, Phoenix, and the San Francisco Bay Area. It will launch in more areas later. Businesses will have the option of opting out of the Duplex call when they get it (the system announces itself as a bot) or by blocking all Duplex calls via their business listing in Google. However, Google thinks businesses will embrace Duplex. We're about to find out."
Android Police,Pixel Stand charges your phone and more for $79,10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/pixel-stand-charges-phone-79/,"  Along with the new hardware announcements at Google's event in New York City, the company also revealed a new accessory for the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL. Appropriated named the Pixel Stand, it's a wireless charging stand that, in typical Google fashion, does more than just recharge your phone. Coming in at $79, the Pixel Stand is a basically upright Qi charger. Once docked, your Pixel 3 will switch to a new UI that features convenient, glanceable information, as well as active voice controls and one-touch suggestions. If you use it for your alarm clock, it will gently wake you up in the morning by mimicking a sunrise over the course of fifteen minutes. It can cycle through some of your pictures from Photos and integrate with some of your smart home products like Nest Hello. And when you're playing music, the phone will show off the cover art, making it a better visual addition to desk or work area than an upright black slate. The Pixel Stand is available for pre-order right now on the Google Store. It comes in a single color, white, for the time being, but have at it. The list of countries where you can buy the Pixel Stand is below: "
Android Police,Pixel 2 trade-in offers now available on Google Store and Project Fi for Pixel 3 buyers,10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/google-pixel-2-2xl-trade-in/,"  Now that Google's much-leaked new Pixel 3 and 3 XL are available for pre-order, it's time for the annual deliberation over whether to purchase the newest hardware. Here's something to factor in: the trade-in values for the Pixel 2 and 2 XL, up on the Google Store and Project Fi now. The Pixel 2's trade-in value is $300 for a 64GB device in good working condition, while the 128GB device is worth $327. For the Pixel 2 XL, a good condition 64GB device is worth $325, while the 128GB variant can net you $335. With pricing starting at $799 for the Pixel 3 and $899 for the Pixel 3 XL, those trade-in values could take a significant chunk off the overall price of the smartphone, though many Pixel fans are noting they're not as tempting as Pixel trade-in deals from previous years. Trade-ins are also available for select devices from Apple, Samsung, LG, Huawei, and Motorola. The Google Store states it's possible to earn up to $400 in trade-in credit, while Project Fi advertises up to $550. Both handsets are available in three colors — Clearly White, Just Black, and Not Pink."
Android Police,"Adobe Acrobat now optimized for Chromebooks, documents can be signed with stylus",10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/adobe-acrobat-now-optimized-chromebooks-documents-can-signed-stylus/,"  Last year, Google worked with Adobe to bring a more complete version of Lightroom CC to Android and Chrome OS, mainly to showcase on the original Pixelbook. This year, Google partnered with Adobe again - this time to optimize the Acrobat PDF reader for Chromebooks. With the ""all-new"" Acrobat, you can fill out forms quickly and sign/annotate them with the Pixelbook pen. The functionality will probably also work with other stylus-equipped Chromebooks, like the Samsung Chromebook Plus/Pro, but that wasn't explicitly confirmed. It's not clear at this time when the new update will roll out. "
Android Police,"Google announces Pixel Slate Chrome OS tablet, available later this year starting at $599",10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/google-announces-pixel-slate-chrome-os-tablet-available-later-year-starting-599/,"  At its hardware event in New York today, Google took the wraps off the Pixel Slate, the company's first tablet running Chrome OS. We knew a lot about it already, but now it's official: it's got a 3:2 aspect ratio screen, a fingerprint scanner in the power button, and optional accessories like a detachable keyboard cover and capacitive stylus. It'll be available later this year starting at $599.  The base model with an Intel Celeron processor, four gigs of RAM and 32 gigs internal storage starts at $599. You can spec it up all the way to a Core i7, 16 GB of RAM, and 256 gigs storage space, but that top-shelf model will cost you — it's $1599, without the folio cover or stylus. To take a tiny bit of the sting out of those prices, the Pixel Slate comes with three free months of YouTube TV. Some exclusive-ish info: Pixel Slate SKUs$599 Celeron - 32GB/4GB$799 Core m3 - 64GB/8GB$999 Core i5 - 128GB/8GB$1599 Core i7 - 256GB/16GB — David Ruddock (@RDRv3) October 9, 2018  The optional stylus is $99, and the keyboard cover will run you another $199. The keyboard is interesting in that it has rounded keys, a divisive design decision — personally, I'm a fan. Those keys are also backlit, which is pretty slick for a detachable cover. It's ""infinitely adjustable"" and can be set to any angle. There's no battery, but it pairs by simply snapping to the bottom of the Slate.  The 12.3-inch LCD screen (a Molecular Display™ in Google parlance) clocks in at 3,000 by 2,000 pixels, which works out to 293 pixels per inch. It also sports stereo front-facing speakers for a robust media experience. Both front and back cameras are eight-megapixel, and the front shooter is wide angle. Those cameras borrow some AI tricks from other Pixel shooters, like single-lens portrait mode. It's got two USB-C ports, but no 3.5-millimeter headphone jack. At 1.2 pounds, the tablet is certainly hefty, but it packs a 48 watt-hour battery.  Unfortunately, there's no release date just yet — we only know it's due before the end of the year. You can find more information on the Google Store."
Android Police,Google Photos Live Albums automatically uploads your best photos to your Home Hub,10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/google-photos-live-albums-automatically-uploads-best-photos-home-hub/,"  One of the features people love most about Google Photos is the automatic backup of pictures and videos. The Home Hub brings that to the next level with Google Photos Live Albums, which automatically uploads your photos to your Home Hub to show you a constantly-changing slideshow.  We'd already spotted this in a Photos teardown last month. Basically, you can select certain people's photos to be displayed on the Home Hub via Photos' face recognition. Whenever you take a new picture and it uploads to Photos, it'll pop up on Home Hub as long as one of the selected faces is included. You'll also be able to share albums based on these photos.  Google will be using machine learning to filter out undesirable (read: blurry, underexposed, random, duplicate) photos so that you don't get crappy photos showing up. So if you were thinking about picking up a Home Hub, here's one more reason to."
Android Police,The $799 Pixel 3 and $899 Pixel 3 XL are official,10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/799-pixel-3-899-pixel-3-xl-official/,"  It's safe to say that none of Google's products have been spoiled like the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL. Beyond the usual press renders and wild sightings, a number of stolen Pixel 3 XL units ended up in the hands of bloggers. There was almost nothing left to the imagination by the time Google officially showed off the pair of phones, but that time has finally come.  Left: Pixel 3 XL, Right: Pixel 3 Despite the many wishes for notch-less 'Pixel Ultra,' the Pixel 3 XL is exactly what everyone expected. It's equipped with a Snapdragon 845 processor, 4GB of RAM, and a 6.3-inch 2960x1440 OLED screen. The large notch on the front contains two 8MP front-facing cameras, one of which can be used for wide-angle selfies.  Google is still going with a single rear camera, at a resolution of 12.2MP. The Pixel 3 XL also supports wireless charging, something that has been missing from Google's phones since the Nexus 5X/6P. The back panel is a soft-touch glass, and Google says the speakers are 40% louder than the Pixel 2's. The smaller Pixel has a slightly different design, with uniform bezels instead of a display notch. It has the same internal hardware, camera setup, and wireless charging support. The main difference is that it uses a smaller 5.5-inch 1080p display. Both phones will be available in three colors - Clearly White, Just Black, and Not Pink. According to the Project Fi website, pricing starts at $799 for the smaller Pixel, and $899 for the Pixel XL."
Android Police,'Home View' and redesigned Google Home app will make smart devices easier to access,10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/home-view-redesigned-google-home-app-will-make-smart-devices-easier-access/,"  Smart home devices are an absolute pain to manage, especially if you use products from multiple different companies. To help make the complicated smart home ecosystem a little simpler, Google is introducing a new 'Home View' for Assistant smart displays, and a redesigned Home app.  The Home View shows all your connected devices at a glance, along with controls for each product. Lights, thermostats, and other smart home devices will be supported. Home View might not offer all the controls available from the product's dedicated application, but it should provide the essential functionality.  Google is also revamping the Home app with the same control panel. We first saw the new app in testing a few months ago, but now it's official. It's not clear when the update will start rolling out, but it will probably be over the coming weeks. "
Android Police,"Google Home Hub is official, costs just $149",10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/google-home-hub-official-costs-just-149/,"  As with everything in today's announcement, the Home Hub has been leaked more than once in recent weeks. Google's own-branded Assistant Smart Display, as expected, resembles a tablet glued onto a fabric speaker base, and it's sadly not removable so it can't be used as a standalone tablet.  The display is a 7"" touchscreen LCD (no resolution given) which makes it smaller than the efforts from Lenovo (8"" and 10"") and JBL (8"") already on the market. Those smart displays have a camera for Duo video calling, something conspicuous by its absence on the Google Home Hub. The front does house two far-field microphones either side of light and color sensors — there's an Ambient EQ setting that finetunes the brightness and color of the display throughout the day. On the back of the screen there's a volume rocker and switch to mute the mics, and on the fabric part we see the familiar Google logo and the port for the 15W power adapter.  Bluetooth and WiFi are on board, just like any Google Home. Functionally, the Hub works the same as other Assistant Smart Displays, but with a few updated UI elements and a new feature called Home View that gives you easy access and control for all of your smart home products. The speakers are referred to as ""full range"" with the specs listed as ""80 dB SPL @ 1KHz, @ 1m"" — they sounded plenty loud in my brief demo and should rival the original Google Home device for sound quality.  The most important detail is surely the price. We knew it was going to be competitive, and it is — Google Home Hub costs just $149, going some way to explaining the lack of a camera (although Google also said privacy concerns were behind this decision). That's $50 less than the 8"" Lenovo Smart Display and $100 less than the JBL Link View, but most importantly, it's $70 cheaper than Amazon's 2nd generation Echo Show, which is what Google is really going after with this product.  To sweeten the deal even further, Google will give you six months of YouTube Premium for free with each purchase (until December). The Chalk and Charcoal colorways that already leaked are also joined by Sand (""not pink"") and Aqua options too. The screen bezels are still white on each model, but with the UI being mostly white, that might actually look better.  Google Home Hub is available to pre-order today and will be in stores from October 22nd in the US ($149), UK (£139), and Australia ($219)."
Android Police,Google aims to create 'closed loop' for user data with new Titan Security mobile chip,10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/google-titan-security-chip/,"  Following a day of bad press regarding an undisclosed security vulnerability, Google pushed the message of strong security during its October 9th hardware reveal event. Among the announcements: the Mountain View-based tech giant has developed a dedicated chip for its mobile devices that integrates Titan Security, the system it built for Google data centers. The Titan Security chip, called Titan M, is integrated into the Pixel 3's secure boot process, and is used to secure the lockscreen, strengthen disk encryption, and protect the integrity of the operating system. ""By combining Titan Security both in the data center and on device, we've created a closed loop for your data across the Google ecosystem,"" said senior vice-president of hardware Rick Osterloh during the event. However, Osterloh's statement that Google is ""committed to the security of users"" didn't ring true for a few Twitter users, one calling the declaration ""ironic"" in the face of the security flaw that unceremoniously shut down Google+ for good, revealed yesterday. Google talking about data safe rn is so ironic 😅 where was Titan security on Google+ — Jonathan Morrison (@tldtoday) October 9, 2018  Putting the gentle ribbing aside, though — custom hardware for the new Pixel is always exciting, especially since we've seen almost everything else in leaks. So far, however, Google has revealed very little about the dedicated chip. On the Pixel 3 product page, a link directs users to a help page for Pixel security settings. This is not the first dedicated hardware security module. The Google Pixel 2 debuted with a module that reinforces the lock screen against malware and hardware attacks."
Android Police,Smart Compose comes to Gmail for Android as Pixel exclusive,10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/smart-compose-comes-android-pixel-exclusive/,"  Google rolled out Smart Compose in Gmail earlier this year, but it was only on the web. Now, it's coming to mobile, but not everywhere on mobile. At Google's hardware event, Rick Osterloh noted that Smart Compose would arrive in Gmail for Android as a Pixel exclusive.  Smart Reply is another fancy machine learning technology that uses the context of what you're writing to suggest text. You might type ""my address is,"" and Smart Compose could suggest your address (if you type it a lot). The demo video showed a swipe from left to right inserting the suggested text in Gmail, but you don't have to accept Google's suggestions. Making this a Pixel exclusive is not without precedent. Features like Assistant and Lens started on Pixel phones before expanding more widely. Odds are that more phones will have Smart Compose before you know it."
Android Police,Google Translate processes 143 billion words every day,10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/google-translate-processes-143-billion-words-every-day/,"  Google Translate is one of the best automated translation services on the planet, and it's used by a massive amount of people every day. At today's 'Made by Google' event, the company revealed that around 143 billion words are translated every single day, across 100 languages. Rick Osterloh, Google's SVP of Hardware, mentioned the statistic while explaining how Google optimized their systems to help people find information faster. ""Now more people can say what they want to say to each other,"" he said."
Android Police,Android 9 Pie beta now available to test for Nokia 6.1 Plus users,10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/android-9-now-available-to-test-for-nokia-6-1-plus-users/,"  Nokia confirmed just last week that it would be rolling out the first wave of Android Pie updates to devices this month, beginning with phones running on the Snapdragon 600-series. True to its word, an Android 9 Pie Beta has now arrived for the Nokia 6.1 Plus, along with the October security patch. The Nokia 6.1 Plus launched in July as a version of the China-exclusive X6. The Nokia 6.1, launched in January, is also due to receive Pie, but the update isn't available on Nokia's website for beta testers yet. The Nokia 7.1 is set to get Pie before the end of the month, while the Nokia 8 and Nokia 8 Sirocco will get Pie next month. Now downloading 😀 pic.twitter.com/hYLeeLKkjP — Aditya Abhay (@AdityaAbhay7) October 9, 2018  Since Nokia is strongly committed to Android One, users can expect a stock experience with minimal bloatware and custom UI, plus update support for at least two years from launch.

Android Police,Watch today's Made by Google event here,10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/watch-todays-made-google-event/,"  Google's yearly hardware launch event is almost upon us. We already went over everything you can expect to see, but the main products of interest will be the Pixel 3 and 3XL, the Chrome OS-equipped Pixel Slate tablet, and the Google Home Hub.  The above livestream will start at 8AM Pacific Time, or 11AM Eastern Time. Are you excited yet?"
Android Police,Instagram is now using machine learning to detect bullying in image uploads,10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/instagram-machine-learning-bullying-detection/,"  In one of the first announcements since Instagram's co-founders departed their company several weeks ago, the social media platform is launching new anti-bullying tools. New head of Instagram Adam Mosseri announced in a blog post that the app is now using machine learning to detect harassment in photos and captions, immediately sending those posts for review. Additionally, the company is expanding its bullying comment filter to live videos. As a quick refresher: the comment filter is also enabled by machine learning. In May 2018, Instagram rolled out the option for users to toggle on a setting that hides bullying comments (as identified by the AI) by default.  The updates come shortly after some high-profile instances of toxicity on the platform, including pop singer Ariana Grande's fans harassing her fiance, comedian Pete Davidson, to the point of his temporary departure from the app. With these changes, Instagram is trying to automate the overwhelming task of moderation — but it may be a drop in the bucket when it comes to stemming the tide of hateful comments on an app known for portraying idealized images and lifestyles. Still, Instagram is attempting to promote better behavior with a new ""spreading kindness"" campaign featuring teen dancer and actor Maddie Ziegler (of Sia music video fame), which encourages users to tag friends and spread a new camera effect with positive, uplifting sentiments. The bullying comment filter on live videos is now available globally, while bullying detection in photos and captions is rolling out over the coming weeks."
Android Police,[Deal Alert] Get the HP Chromebook x360 G1 EE for $250 ($100 off) from Daily Steals with our exclusive coupon,10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/deal-alert-get-hp-chromebook-x360-g1-ee-250-100-off-daily-steals-exclusive-coupon/,"  If you're looking for a Chromebook, but you're on a tight budget, we've got you covered. Right now, you can get the HP Chromebook x360 G1 EE (great name, I know) for just $250 from Daily Steals, using our exclusive coupon. That's $100 off the listed Daily Steals price. The HP Chromebook has a lower-end Intel Celeron N3350, but you still get 4GB RAM, so performance should be fine for basic workloads. The display is a 1366x768 IPS touchscreen with Gorilla Glass 3. This is a convertible laptop, so you can flip the screen around and use it like a tablet. Google says the HP Chromebook will get updates until November 2023, and it has Android app support in the Chrome OS stable channel. Linux applications should also work, since Intel Apollo Lake processors (like the N3350) are supported, but I haven't been able to find confirmation from someone owning this specific model. You can buy the Chromebook from the source link below. You'll have to use coupon code AP360 to get the full discount."
Android Police,The new Chromecast is already up for sale at a UK retailer,10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/new-chromecast-already-sale-uk-retailer/,"  Google is expected to announce a refreshed Chromecast at its hardware event in New York today, but it seems a UK retailer got its timing a little off. Very, online purveyor of clothes, furniture, and electronics, is already selling the new model.  This is a little different from Best Buy, which let a few third-generation Chromecasts out the door prematurely earlier this month. Very's listing is fully functional, complete with the option to add the device to your basket. Aside from a few photos, though, the seller doesn't reveal any new information; all the product details in the listing for this new model are the same as the last one, right down to the price: £29.99. Product images of the third-generation Chromecast. We'll know all about the third-generation Chromecast and all Google's other heavily-leaked new goodies in just a few hours, but if you're champing at the bit for some early-access Chromecast action, you can check out the product listing at very.co.uk."
Android Police,[Update: On sale November 6] OnePlus 6T unveiling set for October 30 in New York,10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/oneplus-6t-unveiling-set-october-30-new-york/,"  After plenty of leaks, rumors, and teasers from the company itself, OnePlus has now set a date for the launch of its next flagship phone. The OnePlus 6T will be announced at an event in New York at 11:00 EDT (8:00 PDT) on October 30th.  Just as with the big Google hardware event tomorrow, there aren't going to be too many surprises when the phone is officially revealed. We know it's going to have a waterdrop notch and we know it'll have an in-display fingerprint solution called 'Screen Unlock.'  Those headline features aside, we're expecting internal specs to be much the same as the OnePlus 6, including the Snapdragon 845 chip and 6 or 8GB of RAM. Sadly, this is going to be the first OnePlus phone to get rid of the headphone jack — but at least the company is now making some USB-C headphones. The launch event will be livestreamed around the world — you'll want to head to oneplus.com/6T/launch on the day. You can also attend the New York show if you want, with tickets available to purchase on the OnePlus site, starting at $20 for early birds. A goody bag containing ""treats which far exceed the price of the ticket"" will be handed out to each attendee.  The OnePlus tradition of slowly releasing details to build hype continues as the company announces that the 6T will go on sale November 6th, one week after the launch event in NYC. If you're in Europe, you'll be able to buy it from 10am GMT on that date, with global sales presumably starting around the same time. Since we know just about everything there is to know about the device itself now, all that's really left to find out is the price."
Android Police,Samsung's new gesture navigation solution actually looks quite promising,10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/samsungs-new-gesture-navigation-solution-actually-looks-quite-promising/,"  Gesture navigation is considered by some to be an important innovation in smartphone UX, not least because it removes the nav bar and allows for more content on the display. It's not easy to get it right, but Apple has done a pretty good job of it and Android OEMs like OnePlus have also had a good go (let's not waste our time discussing Google's Pixel abomination). Samsung's recently announced Galaxy A7 offers another new take on gesture nav, and it actually seems pretty good.  Previous Galaxy devices from the company have included an option to hide the nav bar and show just a little dot for expanding it out again, but this new implementation hides it completely and uses swipes instead. Sammobile spotted the new option, whereby you can swipe up from the bottom in one of three areas to go Home, Back, or to Recents. Since this is Samsung we're talking about, Back is on the right and Recents is on the left (although this can be edited). So, swipe up from the bottom in the middle and you go home, swipe up from the bottom on the right and you go back (and so on).  It's a pretty simple, elegant solution, although you might wonder how easy it is to miss those targets and perform the wrong action. Thankfully, 'Gesture hints' offers subtle on-screen pointers as to where and how big these targets are, making it easier to learn the ropes. You could just as well leave them on indefinitely and you're still getting much more screen real estate with fewer distractions. Without trying it out in person, it's hard to say for certain how well this works, but it definitely shows promise. I like that it doesn't complicate matters by using an entirely different layout — the three options long-time Android users know and love are still there, but gestures are used to activate them. Swiping up from the bottom has also worked well for Apple, so there's no reason it can't work for Samsung, too. Edit: This solution was already previewed as part of Samsung Experience 10 with Android 9 Pie, so you should be able to try it out on your S9 or Note9 soon."
Android Police,Nubia's dual-screen X coming October 31st,10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/nubias-dual-screen-x-coming-october-31st/,"  ZTE, and its subsidiary Nubia, has a thing for dual-screen phones. After it released the Axon M last year, with two screens that unfolded into a single larger display, the company decided to put one on the front and another on the back. Why is it doing this? We’re not really sure, other than it eliminates the need for a selfie camera. The Nubia Z18S leaked in September, and now we have our first look at specs and confirmation of its October 31st launch date. According to Gizmo China, Nubia will release the dual-screen device and brand it as the X. The front LCD measures 6.26 inches while the rear panel is a bit smaller at 5.1 inches and AMOLED. Despite having two displays, the device is only 8.6 millimeters thick, the same as Samsung’s Note 9. The dual-camera setup remains the same as the Z18: 24MP and 16MP.  Nubia’s CEO, Ni Fei, broadcast news of the pending launch via Weibo where he shared the promotional poster above. Powered by the Snapdragon 845, the X will come in black and gold color schemes, and sport a 3800mAh battery. Customers will choose either 64GB or 128GB of storage and also select from 6GB and 8GB RAM options. October 31st is an important date for the company as it’s also the sixth anniversary of the manufacturer."
Android Police,Google Account sign-in prompt adds option to use 'all phones you're signed in to',10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/google-account-sign-prompt-adds-option-use-phones-youre-signed/,"  As part of the 2-step verification settings on your Google Account, there's an option to sign in via a simple 'yes' or 'no' prompt on your phone. This allows you to kick out anyone who's trying to sign in as you while also making it easy to sign in yourself. There's now an additional toggle to enable this on all phones you're currently signed in to.  Before, you had to manually set up each phone you wanted to use the prompt feature with. You could use multiple devices, but there were extra steps to make this possible. With the new setting turned on, you can easily use the prompt on all your signed-in devices without doing anything else, which is handy. You still have to be careful with phones you're no longer using — simply delete them from the list. This update to the settings has been covered by Google's G Suite blog, but it seems to be live for regular, non-business users too."
Android Police,"Google Home and Home Mini coming to The Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark on October 24",10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/google-home-home-mini-coming-netherlands-sweden-norway-denmark-october-24/,"  At its I/O conference in May, Google announced that it would expand Home and Home Mini availability to seven new countries by the end of 2018. The smart speakers have already launched in Mexico, Spain, and, most recently, South Korea. Users from The Netherlands, Sweden, Demnark, and Norway will soon join the party. In an official announcement, Google declared “the wait is over” for Dutch customers eager to get their hands on a Home or Home Mini. The company only recently added support for the language to Google Assistant on phones, and now it's expanding it to its speaker. The full suite of voice commands are available, in addition to custom actions created by third-party developers, as well as smart home controls for brands such as Philips or Nest. Users can also listen to Dutch news sources. Simultaneously, a press release from Nordic Entertainment Group, the company behind the Viaplay streaming service, also notes that the Home devices will make their way to Denmark, Norway, and Sweden on October 24th. This will complete Google’s planned rollout for the year. Its Assistant only recently learned to speak Swedish in August, followed by Danish and Norwegian in September. While we wait for an official announcement from the company regarding these additional countries, Danish users can set their sights on pre-ordering at Elgiganten where the products are already listed, whereas Dutch users can pre-order at Albert Heijn, Bol.com, CoolBlue, and MediaMarkt. Official pre-orders from Google may go live sooner, but in-store availability is set for October 24th. Home will retail for 149€ while its little brother will go for 59€."
Android Police,"Google Pixel 3 AI camera features will include Top Shot, Photobooth, and Super Res Zoom",10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/google-pixel-3-ai-camera-features-will-include-top-shot-photobooth-super-res-zoom/,"  We're just hours away from the launch of the Pixel Ultra 3 and 3 XL and with so many leaks we're wondering if there will be any surprises at all. Since none of the leaked devices up to now have had final software, we were hoping there would be some new things for Google to introduce today, particularly when it comes to imaging. A new report dashes those hopes rather, revealing the Pixel 3's camera features.  According to our friends at 9to5Google, the Pixel 3 will leverage artificial intelligence for new modes to help you get the best photo possible. A feature called Top Shot will allow you to take several images in a burst with on-device machine learning used to help you pick out the superior one. A special prompt will appear titled ""Smart capture available"" with little dots above the resulting images signaling those that Google Camera thinks are most attractive, i.e. those with open eyes or proper smiles.  In a similar vein, a feature called Photobooth will also use AI to get the best shot, except it will work more like Google Clips. Set your Pixel 3 down somwhere and it will take photos when something interesting happens, or when all subjects are aligned and looking at the camera. It sounds like a selfie timer that knows exactly when to hit the shutter for you, but it will also offer you a range of images to choose from. An AI zoom feature potentially called Super Res Zoom is also expected to be unveiled today. There aren't really any further details on this, but it sounds as though there will be some artificial detailing and sharpening past what the regular zoom function can acheive. This latest report also mentions once again that one of the two front-facing cameras will have a wide-angle lens for more expansive selfies. Finally, a subject tracking auto-focus feature is also predicted, which would be pretty neat. With everything the Google Camera app can already do on a Pixel as well as these new features, the Pixel 3 camera is shaping up to be the phone's most enticing aspect once again. We already knew it would support real-time Google Lens analysis, and now it seems we know all of its other secrets, too. We'll find out for sure later on today, with the livestream starting at 8:00 PDT / 11:00 EDT / 16:00 BST."
Android Police,"Google confirms the Home Hub prematurely, posts $25 off promo when buying it with a Chromecast Ultra",10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/google-confirms-home-hub-prematurely-posts-25-off-promo-buying-chromecast-ultra/,"  Google's upcoming Pixel event today has been spoiled nearly from A to Z, but there's a bit of a difference between leaks coming from outside sources and small missteps inside the company that officially confirm unannounced devices. That's the case with this new promo on the Play Store, mentioning the yet-unofficial Google Home Hub. The Home Hub, Google's own take on Assistant Smart Displays, has been leaked several times already. We know what it will look like, we also know it won't have a camera (unlike the JBL Link View and Lenovo Smart Display) and that it will likely cost $149.  What this new promo confirms to us is that the Home Hub will be available to (pre-)order immediately today, and that you'll be able to take $25 off the price if you buy it with a Chromecast Ultra. Now to be clear, this isn't a superb deal on its own — we've seen $20 off the Ultra many times before, and even $39 off once — but if you are planning on getting a Home Hub and Chromecast Ultra today, you won't say no to a discount, no matter how small. There's no other mention of the Home Hub on the Google Store, so that's all we know for now."
Android Police,Sensibo Sky review: A pricey but near-perfect smart controller for your air conditioner (Update: Discount coupon),10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/sensibo-sky-review-pricey-near-perfect-smart-controller-air-conditioner/," Article Contents  If you live in a house with no central climate control, or if you're making an expansion to your house and it's impossible to get a ducted system in place, a ductless setup may be your only hope. Nest, Ecobee, and the dozen other smart thermostats we often talk about aren't compatible with ductless systems, so you have to start thinking creatively if you want connected climate control. The solution comes in the form of small units that can send the same infrared signals as an air conditioner's (AC) remote, but that are themselves WiFi-enabled for remote access. Earlier this summer, I reviewed the Cielo Breez, one of the potential candidates that can smarten up your AC, heat pump, or floor standing unit. I praised it a lot, but was slightly letdown by the outdated design and a few gaps in its smart home compatibility. A few readers recommended I check out Sensibo's alternative solution, so I managed to get my hand on a Sensibo Sky. I have been using it for about a month in my home and have almost nothing but praise for it. In this review, I will use the word AC to refer to the ductless unit I'm controlling with the Sensibo Sky. That's because I have a split AC unit. But keep in mind Sky works with many other types of ductless systems. You can check if your remote is compatible here. The Sensibo Sky is a very minimalistic unit. Its rectangular shape is covered with dark grey matte plastic and glossy black plastic on the front. A Sensibo logo hides an LED light that turns blue when the unit is connecting. The build is good but not overly sturdy, though for a unit you're likely to install once and never touch again, this isn't an issue.  The back of the unit has a MicroUSB port for power, an identifying barcode, and some regulatory inscriptions. There's another port too there, but I'm not sure what it's exactly for. The Sky ships with a USB charger and a USB-A to MicroUSB cable. I found that very convenient as I was able to plug it into my multi-port USB charger next to my bed. The back has a hook as well as a sticker so you can choose whichever mounting method works better for you.  After you plug in the unit, the blue LED light blinks and you can get started with the setup. Grab the Sensibo app and follow the steps to create an account (no Google login, sadly), introduce your unit, teach it your WiFi network, and synchronize with your AC's remote. Sensibo works with plenty of brands and remotes, and if yours is compatible, it shouldn't take more than a couple of seconds for Sky to recognize it and get going. In less than five minutes I was into the app getting my preferences and schedules set up.   Controlling the Sensibo Sky can be done in one of several ways. There are apps for Android (widget above), iOS, and the web. The Android app is responsive and more or less well designed. The main screen lists your different locations and Sensibos, with a quick overview of the current conditions. Choosing a unit expands into a fullscreen control with gradient hues that change according to the time of day. It's a small but neat touch. The interface is all round there, with icons to control the power status, mode, temperature, fan speed, blade direction, and timer. I really enjoy how the different options span out of each button in a circular layout too, but perhaps the icons should be a tad larger. They're quite tiny. You still get the current conditions on top, a settings icon, and a floating action button to quickly set up some automations.  There are three ways you can automate Sensibo: schedules, geofencing, and Climate React. Multiple schedules can be set and repeated on various days of the week; you get to pick the temperature, mode, and fan speed too. For geofencing, you can choose for Sensibo to turn off the AC when you leave, and on when you arrive. However, the most interesting automation is Climate React. This lets you have the AC adjust when the current conditions (temperature, humidity) go below or above a certain threshold.  Left: Schedules. Middle: Geofencing. Right: Climate React. The app comes with a few additional settings and options. A log of recent events lets you see who changed the settings (a user, the AC's regular remote, or Google Assistant) and there are push notifications to stay abreast of any triggered automations. More interestingly, you can share the AC with another member of your household or office, an option that many smart home devices neglect to include and that's necessary when there are multiple adults in charge.  Left: Sensibo options. Middle: Log of recent events. Right: Push notifications. Overall, the Sensibo Android app does nearly everything I want it to. The only thing I find missing compared to Cielo Breez are the neat statistics for usage and temperature. A notification when the AC has been on for a long period of time would be welcome as well. The most convenient aspect of Sensibo is its wide smart home compatibility. It's natively supported on Google Home and Assistant (list of commands), Amazon Alexa, and it has an IFTTT channel. The latter has actions but no triggers, so you can only use IFTTT to turn on/off Sensibo based on some other service's condition. For Google Assistant, your Sensibo unit shows up as any thermostat would. You can assign it to a room, give it a nickname (Tom, in my case — Jerry is the Cielo Breez in the living room), turn it on or off, change the temperature, add it to a routine, and even ask it about the current temperature in the room.  Sensibo's Google Home and Assistant integration. The same commands are available on Google Home, or any Assistant speaker or Smart Display. I tested Sensibo with my Google Home, my JBL Link 20, and JBL Link View, and had no issues, save for the fact that temperature settings can be a little finicky — at least in Celsius. In the video below, you can hear me ask for 22 degrees and yet the AC gets set to 21 degrees. I had this same minor problem with the Cielo Breez too. When I use the Android app, both Sensibo and Cielo set the temperature accurately, but when I ask Assistant, I might get one degree less or more, so there must be something getting lost in translation on Google's side. Update: Sensibo has reached out and explained this was happening because my unit shipped from the US and was identified with Fahrenheit settings even though I had chosen Celsius in the app. By fixing that, Google Home can now perfectly set the temperature each time I issue a command — I was successfully able to ask for every degree from 18 to 30.  Sensibo also has an Open API and a list of integrations, some of which are user contributions. I used this SmartThings tutorial to add Sensibo to my hub and I'm now able to control the AC from the SmartThings app, as well as add it to my routines and scenes. This level of openness makes Sensibo much more interesting if your smart home setup isn't conventional or if you'd rather have backup options in case you decide to move away from your current choice of hub or voice interface.  Left: Sensibo IFTTT applet. Right: Sensibo in SmartThings. Yes, if you can find it for less than $100. Depending on your habits, a smart AC like Sensibo can pay for itself in less than a year. If you often leave the AC on when you leave the house, or if you set it to a very hot/cold temperature when you turn it on and leave it at that the entire time, having something that automatically adjusts while keeping your environment comfortable is not only convenient, it's also very energy-efficient. The smart home integration is a big bonus on top of that. Not only can you control your AC remotely, you can issue voice commands to change its settings, as well as add it to a multitude of other home automation systems. In the month that we've had the Sky installed in our bedroom, my husband and I haven't had to touch the app. I set up a schedule for the AC to turn on at night, so the room is already comfortable by the time we go to bed, I added a geofence so the AC gets turned off if we leave the house (which came in handy a couple of times), and I included it in a few SmartThings routines. For other circumstances, asking Google Home to control it is super handy, and when I don't feel like talking to a machine, I can still use the AC's remote without worries that it might mess up Sensibo's state. It's a no fuss experience that simplifies my life — everything that a smart home gadget should be.  However, at its MSRP of $149, or even its current price of $119, the Sky is a little too expensive. In terms of hardware, it has less hardware than the $99 Cielo Breez (no display, no stand, no buttons), and even if I prefer the minimalistic look of Sensibo, the higher price isn't justified. In terms of features, Sensibo wins by having IFTTT integration, an open API, and an option to share the AC; but Cielo has those very interesting stats and graphs plus more powerful notifications. Both units get the essentials right and work in a very similar manner, so it's hard to choose between the two, but I would personally go for Sensibo if I can find it below $100. Such price drops do happen occasionally. Buy: Sensibo ($119 for a unit, multiple packs are cheaper), Amazon ($118) Discount coupon  Sensibo reached out to us after seeing the review, and since I mentioned that the Sky would be a more palatable buy under $100, the company has issued a special discount coupon for Android Police readers. Use this link or coupon code ANDROIDPOLICE99 to get the prices on Sensibo's website down to $99 for a unit, $198 for two, $247 for three, and $329 for four. We don't know how long the code will be valid for, though, so you might want to act quickly. "
Android Police,"[Update: Android Pie App Actions] Todoist adds dark theme, launches new Wear OS app",10/09/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/09/todoist-adds-dark-theme-android-app-launches-new-wear-os-app/," Article Contents  For dark theme enthusiasts, vindication time is finally here. Not only is Google working on dark themes for many of its apps, several other developers and services have joined the darker side and started implementing these AMOLED-friendly designs in their apps. The latest is Todoist, my personal favorite to-do manager. But that's not the only new thing from the service; it's also rolling out an all-new standalone Wear OS app that lets you manage your tasks without having to install the app on your phone too. Todoist already offers plenty of themes for its Android, iOS, and web apps, but all of them use a white background with various accent colors. The new theme is all dark with a few red accents for some headers and floating actions buttons. You can select it in the app under Settings -> Theme, and since it's free, you don't need Todoist Premium to use it.  Here is a quick look at what you can expect with the dark theme in the task list (left), side menu (middle), and task view (right). It's all very well done with various shades of dark grey making up the interface.  Another silent addition to the Todoist app is proper support for notification channels on Android Oreo and above. This gives you granular control over different types of notifications coming from the app.  The new Todoist app for Wear OS is a standalone offering that doesn't require the Android app to be installed on your phone. You simply sign in with your account and you're good to go. The app's main view is your default project list. You can scroll through it or swipe from the top down to reveal a few other lists: Inbox, Next 7 days, and whichever projects, labels, or filters you have added to your favorites. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a way to browse other non-favorited lists — unless you also have the app on your phone and use that to send it to your watch.  Swiping from the bottom up reveals two options to add a new task and log out. For the former, you can either dictate or type, and once approved, the task will be added to your list.  In the task list, if you tap the checkbox next to any item, it gets marked as completed. If you want to perform other actions, you need to tap and expand the item. These actions include marking it as complete, scheduling it or postponing it, as well as triggering a multiple select process that lets you clear or reschedule items in batches.   While those are all handy features to have on your wrist, it's a little annoying that you can't move tasks from one project to another, or edit labels if needed. I understand that those options are better done with a larger display, but having access to them on the go could be essential for a true standalone Todoist experience. The new Wear OS app also supports complications. Your daily and weekly goals, day progress, and a shortcut to the app can be added to compatible watchfaces.   The new version of Todoist also includes Android 9 Pie's App Actions, letting you quickly access a to-do list from your app drawer. App Actions rely on AI and your usage patterns though, so you'll only see the Todoist suggestions if you're likely to open a specific task list instead of some other app.  All of these features have been available for beta testers of the Todoist app for a couple of weeks, but they're recently started to roll out to the stable app now. Edit: Todoist tells us it's still ironing out some bugs in the Android app and the official release will roll out next Monday, October 15. You can grab it from the Play Store widget below or APK Mirror.

Android Police,Google updates Gmail API policies for developers and will require app reviews with security assessments,10/08/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/08/google-updates-gmail-api-policies-developers-will-require-app-reviews-security-assessments/,"  Since the beginning of the year, Google has worked on Project Strobe, an extensive review of third-party developer access to the data of your Google Account and Android device. The operation also analyzed the company’s underlying philosophy of how information is used by other apps. As part of its findings and changes, it determined that users give third-party access to their Gmail with only specific intentions. Consequently, limits will be implemented for which use cases will be permitted. The User Data Policy for the consumer Gmail API has been updated to reflect the stricter standard. Going forward, only apps ""directly enhancing email functionality"" will be allowed to use the data. Furthermore, there are new restrictions on how that data can be handled and some apps may have to undergo security assessments, which developers must pay for on their own. There’s been a lot of misinformation about the handling of email data, especially in the U.S. Congress, which Google has responded to. Ultimately, users have willingly provided access to their information, but the company is taking more steps to ensure developers don’t abuse it. According to the new policy, both native and webmail clients and apps for backing up email automatically are permitted. Services such as CRM, mail merge, or reporting services like package delivery updates will also be allowed under the new policy. These can use the Covered Scopes for Gmail, which are APIs that allow the reading, creating, or modification of messages, and controlling mailbox access and settings. Other apps may use these Covered Scopes as long as they limit the use of data to only provide the features that a user expects, and may not transfer information to serve ads. Google explicitly prohibits human access to the data except in specific scenarios including security purposes and complying with applicable laws. Notably, the limits also apply to anonymized data or information that comes from it. These changes follow the introduction of Gmail Add-ons which allow developers to integrate their services into Gmail. To enhance security while interfacing with these features, Gmail is introducing granular permissions, whereby users are asked to give an app access for each one individually as they are needed. An app review and external security assessment process will begin next year. On January 9th, 2019, developers using Covered Scopes will be able to submit their programs to Google for the first stage of the process. The deadline for submitting the review is February 15th, 2019. If one is not turned in, the company will begin to revoke user access. This process will ensure compliance with the new policies regarding limited use, appropriate access, and minimum scope. Following this, a third party will complete the security assessment. Google estimates that the fee for this will range from $15,000 – $75,000, and possibly more, although it depends on the specific of the app. Alternatively, developers may provide a certification of previous inspection if it has gone through a similar one. Google has published a wealth of information regarding the new procedures. Developers who make use of Gmail APIs should thoroughly read through the new policies before ensuring the compliance of their apps."
Android Police,Google accounts will soon have more granular control over third-party app permissions,10/08/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/08/google-is-providing-more-granular-google-account-permissions/,"  It's the day before Google's big annual hardware event, and the company is busy weathering some major bad press. Google+ for consumers is shutting down, and far from being a graceful death, its demise is pinned on a March 2018 bug that was not disclosed until today. The company says this is because it simply didn't meet the necessary thresholds for reporting, but the Wall Street Journal reports it was because the company feared regulation. Either way, the news casts a shadow over the Pixel event, and completely distracts from the other small but useful tweaks the company released today regarding privacy, in particular the fact that it is now rolling out more granular Google account permissions. Over the next few months, Google will begin providing more fine-grained control over what account data Google users can choose to share with third-party apps. The change makes it so users must individually grant or deny each permission to access data in their consumer Google account, rather than accept or deny permissions all at the same time. In other words, when an app requests access to Google account data, multiple dialog boxes pop up, each with a request for a particular permission, rather than one large dialog box with all the requested permissions (i.e. location, contacts, calendars) lumped together.  How the Google Account permissions dialog box looks now, as opposed to the new version in header. As I noted above, this change isn't major, but it is a step in the right direction. When the permissions show up all in one dialog box, it feels daunting — like an all-or-nothing decision. Soon, there will be more nuance. In addition, Google is now limiting use cases for accessing Gmail permissions, and limiting the ability of third-party apps to receive call log and SMS permissions on Android devices, as well as nixing contact interaction data from the Android Contacts API. Whether all this is enough to convince regulators and the public that Google can self-regulate is another story entirely, but from the media response we've seen today, it likely won't be this easy."
Android Police,[Deal Alert] Save up to $50 on JBL Bluetooth speakers and Google Assistant-enabled headphones,10/08/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/08/deal-alert-save-50-jbl-bluetooth-speakers-google-assistant-enabled-headphones/,"  JBL is currently running a fall sale on all kinds of audio goodies. In addition to the Link View smart display, a number of desirable JBL products are significantly discounted, including the Xtreme 2 Bluetooth speaker, which is $50 off, and a number of Google Assistant-enabled headphones, most of which are also $50 off.  The Xtreme 2 is a big, ruggedized Bluetooth speaker, boasting IPX7 water resistance and a purported 15 hours of battery life. It also comes with an over-the-shoulder carrying strap that has an integrated bottle opener, which is certainly a novel addition. Normally $299.95, it's currently discounted to $249.95.  Also on sale are JBL's Everest 110GA, 310GA, and 710GA, three models of Bluetooth headphones with Google Assistant integration. The 110 are in-ear, and are on sale for $79.95, $20 off their usual $99.95. The 310 and 710 are both $50 off; the former is an on-ear set for $149.95, while the latter is a bigger over-ear model going for $199.95. All three provide access to the Google Assistant with the press of a button and can read incoming notifications out loud, Pixel Buds-style. These deals are available from plenty of retailers. There are others, too, including savings on additional Bluetooth speakers and non-Assistant headphones. You can peruse the full list at JBL's sale page, or hit the source links below to check out the ones named here."
Android Police,Google to more closely monitor SMS and phone permissions of apps on Play Store,10/08/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/08/google-closely-monitor-sms-phone-permissions-apps-play-store/,"  The Play Store may be packed with content, but there are some pretty strict rules in place when it comes to the things apps distributed by Google can do, and once in a while those rules are refreshed or tweaked. Starting this month, Google has refined its Developer Program Policies to include limits to call log and SMS permission access, explicit prohibitions against surveillance and ""commercial spyware apps,"" and new Android Contacts API restrictions.  The biggest developer-facing change is likely to be the SMS and call log API access restrictions, paired with the planned death of portions of the Contacts Provider API, which goes into effect this coming January 7th. In short, some Call Log and SMS data can only be accessed by apps set as ""default"" for those actions — though there are exceptions like backup or voicemail apps. For more information about how things will change, be sure to check out the relevant section of the developer documentation, as well as the overall policy changes for User Data and Permissions. Google's Malicious Behavior policy now explicitly includes prohibitions against surveillance and commercial spyware, and the Enforcement section now has better explanations for the extent of Google's policy coverage and actions that may be taken against policy violators. Google is also clarifying to prevent developers from misrepresenting target age group requirements of child or family-focused apps. For the full details, I encourage developers to review Google's notes for October's policy updates, especially if app-making is your bread and butter."
Android Police,"JBL Link Bar orders delayed, likely won't ship this year",10/08/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/08/jbl-link-bar-orders-delayed-likely-wont-ship-year/,"  Android TVs and Home units have become the hallmark of a smart home powered by Google. We’ve seen a fair share of Android TV boxes from a variety of manufacturers, including the Nvidia Shield. For the most part, they offered the same features in slightly-different packages. But when Google announced the JBL Link Bar, we witnessed a different product entirely. Sadly, pre-orders for the Android soundbar have now been hit with delays. B&H originally expected the product to be available on October 16th, but Twitter user Nate Harris shared an email from the retailer informing him that ""your order will most likely not be filled by the end of this calendar year."" According to the store, blame for the delay rests on JBL.  The 100W soundbar runs Android TV when the set is powered on and continues to serve even when the television is off. The Link Bar will give access to all your favorite voice commands, whether it’s controlling the lights, or dropping the beat for a party by using Google Assistant. It also includes Bluetooth for music streaming from other devices and even a 'PrivacySwitch' to disable microphones when you don’t want the Assistant listening to you. Given the lack of availability details, customers may look to the Sonos Beam. Although it won't feature Android TV, it is a soundbar that includes Alexa support and is slated to receive Google Assistant compatibility at some point soon."
Android Police,Metro by T-Mobile plans are available today with 5G coming in 2019,10/08/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/08/metro-t-mobile-plans-available-today-5g-coming-2019/,"  It was announced that MetroPCS would become Metro by T-Mobile a couple of weeks ago, the re-branding coming with some enticing perks like free Amazon Prime membership. The shift took place today — and apparently award-winning actor and producer Keegan-Michael Key is the new service's first customer.  The newly-christened Metro by T-Mobile offers four relatively easy to understand rate plans that cost between $30 and $60 for a single line. The $50 and $60 plans each include unlimited data as well as Google One membership at the 100-gigabyte level. The $60 plan also comes with a subscription to Amazon Prime for new Prime members. Sign-ups start today at Metro stores around the US. Keegan-Michael Key introduced the service today at a Metro pop-up event in New York.  In a press release, T-Mobile announced that Metro will have 5G plans available in 2019, making it ""the first prepaid wireless service provider to commit to 5G service."" If you're in New York and really excited about prepaid wireless service, you can stop by the Metro event at Grand Central until 6 tonight and tomorrow from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. 5G, with its super-low latency, increased capacity and insanely fast speeds, promises to redefine wireless as we know it. And now, Metro by T-Mobile is redefining prepaid by announcing plans to launch 5G services next year. Metro customers have come to expect nothing less when it comes to advanced wireless technologies -- in 2010, Metro beat AT&T, Verizon and the rest of the industry to the punch with the first LTE network in the country. “When we talk about 5G for All, it’s not just nationwide 5G service but it’s all shades of T-Mobile, Magenta and Purple,” said Neville Ray, Chief Technology Officer at T-Mobile. “5G is going to be huge. It’ll transform the wireless experience. Metro by T-Mobile customers deserve access to the latest technology, and we’ll make sure they get it.” Keegan-Michael Key is Customer #1 at the New Metro by T-Mobile At the Metro by T-Mobile Pop-Up Experience in New York City’s Grand Central Terminal, noted actor, producer and -- most importantly -- savvy wireless consumer, Keegan-Michael Key became the very first Metro by T-Mobile customer. Here, he introduces the new Metro by T-Mobile at a press event. On October 8 from 9 am to 6 pm and October 9 from 8 am to 6pm, the Metro by T-Mobile Pop-Up Experience in Grand Central lets visitors explore interactive demos from Metro by T-Mobile, Amazon Prime and Google One and step into the future with 5G demos featuring virtual and augmented reality along with photo booths and digital and physical mementos of the day. The Pop-Up Experience also highlights all the benefits of the new Metro by T-Mobile—a 4G LTE network, the best of shopping and entertainment from Amazon Prime, and expanded cloud storage and mobile backup with Google One. The savviest attendees can even make the switch right there onsite to join Keegan-Michael Key as Metro by T-Mobile customers! Metro by T-Mobile Breaks from Conventional Wisdom For many, the perception of prepaid wireless service meant subpar devices, service and coverage. But, Metro has been quietly changing the prepaid landscape for years, and today, the company takes a giant wireless leap forward for customers. Starting today, at 10,000+ Metro by T-Mobile stores nationwide, wireless customers can score new all-unlimited rate plans featuring Amazon Prime and Google One all on the ultra-advanced T-Mobile network. Longtime Metro customers can also benefit from the new rate plans. All they have to do is come into a Metro store or contact Metro by T-Mobile’s outstanding customer care team to make the switch. “I couldn’t be more proud of today’s launch and what it means for our customers and potential customers. Truly nationwide and unlimited service on the most advanced LTE network and now with Amazon Prime and Google One. There’s not a better value in wireless,” said Tom Keys, President, Metro by T-Mobile. “And with a commitment to bring 5G to life in 2019, we’re making it crystal clear: Metro by T-Mobile customers aren’t making a compromise. They’re refusing to make a compromise.” Serious Value with Amazon Prime The top tier of the new Metro by T-Mobile plans now includes Amazon Prime, giving customers the best of shopping and entertainment from Amazon including Prime Free One-Day Shipping and Prime Free Same-Day Delivery in more than 8,000 cities and towns and unlimited Free Two-Day Shipping on more than 100 million items. Prime members enjoy unlimited access to award-winning movies and TV episodes including Emmy-winning The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, critically-acclaimed Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan, and the Oscar-nominated box office success The Big Sick with Prime Video, and Prime Music which offers members unlimited streaming and ad-free listening to today’s best-selling artists with access to two million songs. Plus, members can get deep discounts on select popular products at Whole Foods Market and an additional 10 percent off hundreds of sale items. Prime members also receive unlimited free photo storage with Amazon Photos. First with Google One Metro by T-Mobile is the only wireless provider to offer plans with Google One. Google One is a plan that gives you expanded storage that you can share with your family, direct access to Google experts and other members-only benefits across Google – and, it comes with mobile backup so you can securely back up your phone’s photos, videos and multimedia messages sent via Android Messages.

Android Police,"Logi Circle app updated with camera grid rearrangement, new settings layout, and more",10/08/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/08/logi-circle-app-updated-camera-grid-rearrangement-new-settings-layout/,"  Logitech was among the first companies to embrace the new wave of cloud-connected home security cameras with its Circle line. Now, everyone makes them. Logitech's Android app has been a little lacking in the past, but it has made solid improvements over time. The latest update includes a few long-awaited features, too.  Here's the changelog for Circle v3.3. In the newly revamped settings menu, you'll find the cameras right at the top. Each one has an overflow icon to access its settings. To rearrange the cameras in the main grid view, you can long-press and drag in the settings (see above). Back in the grid view, you'll get snapshots of recent activity. As of the new update, those images include timestamps. The new update does not, unfortunately, allow the app to work in portrait mode. It's all still landscape. "
Android Police,RuneScape Mobile members-only beta starts today,10/08/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/08/runescape-mobile-members-beta-starts-today/,"  If you are not a RuneScape fan, then you probably weren't aware that there are two different versions of RuneScape available on PC. One is called Old School RuneScape, and the more modern version is known merely as RuneScape, though it's sometimes called RuneScape 3. Old School RuneScape is set for release on Android this October 30th, and while the regular version of RuneScape is also coming to Android, an official release date is still unknown. The good news is that if you would like to try it out, a members-only beta has officially started today.   In order to play in this beta, you will need a subscription to the game. A one-month membership will run you $10.99. As far as I can tell, there is no need to join the beta on a separate web page, but access is only offered on a first come, first served basis. If you can't get into the beta right now, you'll have to wait until Jagex opens more slots. Currently, a few issues are plaguing this beta release, so the experience is hardly perfect. Freezing can happen, some tutorials can't be completed, and the UI could surely use some more work. This is a beta, after all, so you should definitely expect a few issues here and there. At the very least it is mostly playable, which is a good sign.  If you'd like to stay up to date with anything to do with RuneScape and its impending release on Android, you can keep an eye on RuneScape News for the latest info. Past that, your guess is as good as mine as to when we will see the official release of RuneScape on Android. The current members-only beta inevitably means we are edging closer to an official release, but there's clearly a lot more work to be done before it's ready for the masses. But if you'd like to give it an early look despite a few issues, make sure to hit that install button in the widget below. Oh, and don't forget to purchase the required membership on the official website.  The biggest ever RuneFest heralds the launch of RuneScape Mobile’s Members Beta.

Monday 8th October 2018, Cambridge, UK – Access to RuneScape Mobile’s new Members Beta is being made available from today, Jagex has announced. This limited Beta marks the next step in bringing RuneScape to mobile devices, as the development team continues to work closely with the RuneScape community to deliver the optimum player experience over the coming months. Jagex made the announcement at RuneFest, its biggest ever player convention, held this past weekend at Farnborough International Exhibition and Conference Centre. RuneScape Mobile, which on full release will be available on both iOS and Android devices for free-to-play and subscribing players, features full, cross-platform interoperability with PC platforms, allowing for adventures to continue while on the sofa or on the move. The milestone announcement follows hot on the heels of Old School RuneScape Mobile, which has been enjoying a successful Members Beta over the summer, and is scheduled to launch on mobile devices on 30th October. Further announcements from RuneFest came thick and fast this weekend: RuneScape: new World Event launches today, ‘Mining and Smithing’ rework incoming.
The RuneScape team announced that ‘Till Death Do Us Part’, an all-new World Event in RuneScape and the first since 2016, launches today. Taking place throughout October, the event sees the game’s version of the Four Riders of the Apocalypse emerge on Gielinor. Additionally, the team introduced new quests and fan-voted content that will launch this winter, including the Mining and Smithing rework; the time-looping, investigative adventure ‘Needle Skips’; and the final part of the Elite Dungeons trilogy, a new boss encounter for hardy adventurers that sheds light on the mysterious Ambassador. Old School RuneScape: The Lost City of the Elves in 2019, and an expansion to Zeah announced.
Headline announcements for Old School RuneScape saw the team confirm key content soon to be polled to players. This includes the elven city of Prifddinas, which launched in RuneScape in 2014. If successfully polled, the city would be reinterpreted and introduced into the nostalgic iteration next year. Entry to the city relies on the completion of a new Grandmaster quest, ‘Song of the Elves’ – which will conclude an Old School RuneScape questline for the first time since the game launched in 2013. Furthermore, players will be polled on an expansion of the Old School-exclusive continent of Zeah. If successful, the content would see its unexplored lands to the west uncovered and expanded in 2019 with the release of the Kebos Lowlands, and feature a raft of new adventures and activities for players to explore. World premiere of ‘RuneScape Live’ performed by The Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra
RuneFest began courtesy of the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra and the world premiere of RuneScape Live: Gielinor in Harmony, a musical extravaganza that took the audience on an orchestral and story-driven journey through the world of Gielinor. Featuring a brand-new storyline written by RuneScape’s narrative team, which saw a RuneScape and an Old School RuneScape player complete a quest in each other’s game world, Gielinor in Harmony set the tone for the revelries to continue. RuneFest itself presented thousands of players with an immersive festival experience set in Rellekka, the Viking-inspired northern lands of RuneScape. In addition to keynote reveals and announcements, players completed activities based on the game’s Fremmenik Trials, attended behind-the-scenes talks hosted by developers, and went hands-on with both RuneScape and Old School Mobile. Phil Mansell, CEO, Jagex said:
“RuneFest is at the heart of our living games philosophy, and it has played an enormous part in growing our RuneScape games to become a $1billon success story. It brings the games, our players, and the Jagex team together to share an incredible experience that exists outside of the game. This was the biggest and best RuneFest ever, and reflects the continuing strong growth in the communities playing our games. RuneScape Live was also incredible, and I thank our team and the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra for an unforgettable night. “We had a great time revealing our plans for RuneScape and Old School RuneScape over the coming months, and it was brilliant to see the reaction from our players both at RuneFest as well as on the live stream. We’re just three weeks away from bringing Old School RuneScape to mobile devices, which has already been incredibly well received by players. The announcement that RuneScape Mobile is also beginning its limited Members Beta from today, and will open to more members over the coming weeks and months, means that both our communities will soon enjoy their adventures through Gielinor while on the move.
“Every year, RuneFest delivers a fantastic celebration of the games and our community, but it’s also a great opportunity for us to look ahead to what’s to come. Thank you to everybody who travelled to RuneFest’s new home at Farnborough, and we’re looking forward to returning next autumn.” - Ends - Notes for Editors

Android Police,Google is putting Google+ out of its misery following data exposure,10/08/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/08/google-plus-shutdown/,"  Google is shutting down the consumer version of its Google+ social network following the discovery of a vulnerability that allowed app developers access to private profile information. While found and patched in March 2018, it was not disclosed until today. According to an internal memo viewed by the Wall Street Journal, Google feared disclosing the issue would be detrimental to its reputation and draw unwanted regulatory attention.  Google reports that it found no evidence that any developer was aware of the bug, or that any abuse occurred. However, up to 500,000 Google+ profiles were affected by the vulnerability, and 438 applications may have used the API. In a memo viewed by WSJ that was sent to senior executives, including CEO Sundar Pichai, Google's legal and policy staff stated that disclosing the incident would trigger ""immediate regulatory interest."" For that reason, it delayed releasing the information, though a day before its major annual hardware event is far from ideal timing for any bad press. Additionally, it's important to note that Google doesn't give the same leeway to vendors under its vulnerability disclosure policy — it promises to wait only 90 days before publicly disclosing the issue. However, Google writes in its blog post that the issue didn't hit the necessary thresholds for disclosure when it came to things like evidence of misuse, or whether there were any actions a developer or user could take in response. Google says it found the vulnerability as part of its Project Strobe review of third-party developer access to Google account and Android device data. Through Strobe, which launched earlier this year, one of its first priorities was to review all APIs related to Google+. Beyond finding the bug, Google finally admitted the truth, writing in the blog post: ""This review crystallized what we’ve known for a while: that while our engineering teams have put a lot of effort and dedication into building Google+ over the years, it has not achieved broad consumer or developer adoption, and has seen limited user interaction with apps. The consumer version of Google+ currently has low usage and engagement: 90 percent of Google+ user sessions are less than five seconds."" Google says it will give users a 10-month period to transition out of Google+, slated for completion by the end of next August. It also promises to provide consumers with more information, including options for downloading and migrating data, over the coming months. Google+ will live on in a limited capacity, however, as an enterprise tool. The company notes that it will be ""launching new features purpose-built for businesses,"" and that it'll share more information in the coming days. In addition to the sunsetting of Google+, Project Strobe brings in new, more granular controls over the data Google Account owners share with apps."
Android Police,Redesigned Google Assistant settings page is rolling out,10/08/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/08/redesigned-google-assistant-settings-page-rolling/,"  As Google Assistant has gotten more powerful, the settings have also gotten more complicated. A new layout has been popping up intermittently over the last few weeks, but now it looks like it's rolling out more widely. Curious? We've got some screens below.  The old Assistant settings UI was just one long screen broken up into sections for account, devices, and services. The new settings page has tabs, and the organization is a little more rational. On the left, you have Personal Info. That's where you can change your nickname, payment info, and so on. Next, there's Assistant. This is where you change the settings for Assistant voices, languages, home control, and additional Assistant features. The Services tab has all of the settings for devices and services that are connected to Assistant. You can see how the new settings screens look in the images above. Nothing strikes me as out of place aside from the home control menu. I think that should be in Services rather than Assistant. Keep an eye out for this UI to appear on your devices."
Android Police,[Deal Alert] Google One subscribers can save up to $25 on Google Express,10/08/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/08/deal-alert-google-one-subscribers-can-save-25-google-express/,"  Google One's benefits extend beyond storage space and customer service. Subscribers can save 20 percent on their next order from Google Express, up to $20. ""Some qualified users"" are eligible for an even larger discount of 25 percent, up to $25; Google doesn't explain what makes a qualified user, however.  Qualified users will be notified of the promotion either by an email, a notification in the Google One app, or on Google Express. Choosing to redeem the offer will add the promo code to your Google Express cart. As Google Express continues to expand at an impressive pace, 20 to 25 percent off your order could mean savings on just about anything you could want. Not a bad perk, especially if you're on the $1.99-per-month Google One plan. Some brands and products are excluded from the promo, although Google doesn't say which. Coupon codes are good through the end of the year."
Android Police,"Roku Premiere is now available, offering 4K streaming for $40",10/08/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/08/roku-premiere-4k-streaming-player-now-available/,"  The streaming hardware industry is a highly competitive place. No sooner had Roku introduced its Premiere 4K player in late September for a market-beating $40, than Amazon launched the Fire Stick 4K for a mere $10 more, with support for all three major HDR standards (HDR10, HDR10+, and Dolby Vision) plus Dolby Atmos for sound. But while the Premiere only offers HDR10 and is a bit bigger than a streaming stick, many prefer its user interface and remote design. Roku also beats Amazon to market by a small margin — it's available as of today, October 8th, while the Fire Stick TV 4K starts shipping October 31st. In addition to the Fire Stick 4K, Roku's main competitor is the Chromecast Ultra, which supports HDR10, Dolby Vision, and Dolby Atmos for sound — plus comes in dongle form — but costs substantially more than the Premiere at $69. We may also see a refreshed Chromecast with Bluetooth and improved Wi-Fi reception at Google's October 9th event, but unfortunately it doesn't seem like it will add 4K support. The Roku Premiere is available at the Roku online store, Amazon, and Best Buy. Meanwhile, the Roku Ultra 4K streaming player with JBL headphones and voice remote is now available for pre-order on Amazon and Best Buy for $99."
Android Police,Duolingo adds courses for Hawaiian and Navajo languages,10/08/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/08/duolingo-adds-courses-hawaiian-navajo-languages/,"  Duolingo is a great resource for anyone looking to sharpen their second-language skills. The platform already offered 30 courses for English speakers, and now it's adding two more in celebration of Indigenous Peoples' Day: the Hawaiian ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi, and the Navajo language Diné.  Hawaiian and Navajo are endangered languages spoken by people native to the United States. By last estimate, there are about 170,000 native speakers of Navajo, making it the most-spoken indigenous language in the country. Hawaiian, on the other hand, was only spoken by about 2,000 people as of 2007. Starting today, both courses are available in beta to all Duolingo users; there are already about 2,400 people taking the Hawaiian course and 2,000 taking Navajo. A question from Duolingo's Hawaiian course. To create the Hawaiian course, Duolingo worked with Hawaiian education groups Kanaeokana and Kamehameha Schools. The Navajo course is being developed in conjunction with Utah's San Juan School District. The addition of Hawaiian and Navajo language courses is part of a larger effort to preserve endangered languages, according to Duolingo. A question from Duolingo's Navajo course. You can check out both courses now in the Duolingo app.  Kanaeokana, a network of over 50 Hawaiian culture-based schools and educational organizations, has partnered with Kamehameha Schools and Duolingo, the most popular language-learning platform in the world, to launch a free online ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi course. Duolingo has over 300 million users around the world, and people have been requesting the Hawaiian language for years. “So many people in our community cherish ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi, but not all of them have the time or resources to take classes,” said Pōkiʻi Seto, a member of the development team. “Duolingo’s course allows ʻohana to build a connection to ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi whenever and wherever they can.” “I jumped at the chance to work with Duolingo because of how closely it aligns with Kanaeokana’s goals to renormalize ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi,” continued Seto. “The Hawaiian language movement is carrying our ʻōlelo to places we never thought it would go. And that’s how it should be.” In the kingdom era, Hawaiian was spoken by Americans, British, Chinese, Greeks, Spaniards, Tahitians and more, and people in the Hawaiian-language community see Duolingo’s new course as an opportunity to help renormalize the language. “Our language is our foundation, but it is also the language of this land, and everyone, Hawaiian or not, can connect to the ʻāina more deeply through it,” said Keiki Kawaiʻaeʻa, a Hawaiian language expert who is a major part of Kanaeokana’s Hawaiian language renormalization efforts. Kawaiʻaeʻa continued, “This course is not about replacing classes; it’s about making ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi more accessible. If you are too busy to enroll in classes or even if you just want to brush up on what you learned, Duolingo is an accessible resource. We hope that families and friends will take the opportunity to use the app as a fun and convenient way to engage in learning Hawaiian together.” Most of Duolingo’s courses are created by bilingual volunteers from around the world. Since there are relatively few speakers of ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi, Kanaeokana and Kamehameha partnered to bring together a group of Hawaiian-language specialists from across the islands to create the initial content set. “Duolingo is a true innovation in mobile language-learning,” said Kāʻeo Duarte, Vice President of Community Engagement and Resources at the Kamehameha Schools, a Kanaeokana member. “Bringing ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi to this platform is just continuing the tradition of our ancestors in the nineteenth century who embraced the new technology of print to pass on our traditions and moʻolelo.” ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi will be available on Duolingo’s website on October 8, 2018, to coincide with Indigenous Peoples’ Day.

Diné culture, after flourishing for hundreds of years was attacked by settlers. Diné speakers were forced to speak English and assimilate in the late 1800s. Though it’s now classified as an endangered language, a decades-long revitalization effort has created a growing pool of Diné speakers. Why Diné on Duolingo? Diné is the language of the Navajo people, and learning it opens up the stories and rich history of Navajo culture. Diné is a living language that grows and shifts for the contemporary needs and goals of its speakers; thus, it makes sense for it to live in new channels like Duolingo. Duolingo is the world’s largest language-learning platform, with 300 million total learners worldwide. By adding Diné to its course offerings, the language will be made accessible for free to millions of people who are eager to learn it – whether it’s for strengthening connections to cultural roots, learning more about the local communities in the 4 corners region, enhancing travel experiences or simply out of curiosity. The course will feature skills that teach learners about Diné culture and (eventually) use original audio recorded by native Diné speakers. More broadly, launching a Diné course is part of a larger initiative at Duolingo to add courses for languages that are considered at-risk and endangered. Who’s involved? As with most Duolingo courses, the Diné course is being developed via the Duolingo Incubator by a team fluent in Diné and English and dedicated to the Diné language revival movement. The development of the course is led jointly by 1) Duolingo and 2) San Juan School district educators and San Juan High School students, who are supporting the course creation. Work on the course officially began in July 2018, and the course is slated to launch on October 8, 2018 – in time for Indigenous People’s Day in the U.S. For more information, please contact: Clayton Long Bilingual Director, San Juan School District [email protected] Michaela Kron Senior PR Manager, Duolingo [email protected] Myra Awodey Project Manager, Duolingo [email protected] (412) 354-0782 (404) 210-9945 "
Android Police,"Asus reveals another low-end Chromebook, the C423",10/08/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/08/asus-reveals-another-low-end-chromebook-c423/,"  Are you waiting for a successor to the Chromebook Flip C302? Too bad, because Asus is giving us another low-end Chromebook instead. Following the entry-level C223NA that launched last month (our review is coming soon), Asus has quietly listed another inexpensive Chromebook on its site - the C423. There appear to be two variations of the C423. One has an Intel Celeron N3350 processor with a 14-inch 1366x768 non-touch display, and the other has a Pentium N4200 with a 1080p touchscreen. The former model should probably be avoided - the N3350 is a terrible CPU, and the resolution is far too low for a 14-inch screen.  Asus also isn't saying how much RAM the base model has, but I'm guessing 2GB. On the bright side, there are plenty of connectivity options, and the touchpad is fairly large. No pricing is available yet, but if the base model is more than $200, I would skip buying it."
Android Police,"Piffle is a cute arcade puzzler from Hipster Whale, the creators of Crossy Road",10/08/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/08/piffle-cute-arcade-puzzler-hipster-whale-creators-crossy-road/,"  There is no doubt that Hipster Whale is best known for its immensely popular endless arcade hopper Crossy Road, but did you know this is also the same company that developed Pac-Man 256 and Shooty Skies? That's a solid track record that speaks for itself, but if you've been wondering what the studio has been up to since Disney Crossy Road landed on the Play Store in 2016, then you'll want to take a look at its new self-published title Piffle, an adorable multi-ball brick-breaking game that mixes in some of the familiar bubble popping gameplay from Bust-a-Move.   As you can clearly see in the trailer linked above, this release is indeed a cutesy Kawaii-themed multi-ball brick breaking game (similar to Ketchapp's Ballz). There are numbered bricks at the top of each stage, and it's your job to remove them by shooting adorable Piffle balls at those blocks until they are gone. Unlike most brick-breakers, you can choose where you shoot your balls, much like you would in the bubble-popper Bust-a-Move. Not only does this free you up to strategically align your shots, but it's also a handy way to collect the many Piffle balls scattered around each stage. When it comes to Piffle balls, the more you can obtain, the more you can shoot, which is precisely how you are going to clear all those bricks. Now, the gameplay is pretty solid, if a little familiar, but with free-to-play games like this, it always comes down to how fairly the title is monetized, and sadly the in-app purchases do indeed range up to $99.99 per item. These IAPs are mainly used for coin packs, and those coins can be used to help you craft new Piffle balls. Sadly this monetization is not revealed to you until you unlock crafting at level 18, which is a shady way to get players hooked on the gameplay before they figure out the actual method of monetization.  Hipster Whale's Piffle, at its core, can be a fun little brick-breaking title. The adorable theme should appeal to the casual audience it has been designed to attract, though hiding the egregious IAPs from the player until they unlock the crafting mechanics at level 18 sure doesn't win it any favors. Like most free-to-play games, everything starts out easy enough, but once you advance a bit, you'll discover the later levels are very difficult to clear without some paid help. I suppose that's to be expected, but it definitely tarnishes the experience of an otherwise solid release. "

Android Police,[Update: Soft launch?] A future version of Android will have a manual device backup option,10/08/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/08/future-version-android-will-manual-device-backup-option/,"  Google has offered some rudimentary backup functionality in Android since the 2.0 days, but it improved backup functionality in 6.0 Marshmallow. However, you still have to trust that the Google Drive backups are happening as there are no user-facing controls. That's going to change in a future version of Android, though.  This news comes from Google itself in an issue tracker thread, and for once it wasn't the product of an internet mob adding hundreds of stars. Someone posted that Android ought to have the option to manually start a backup rather than trusting the process to happen when the device is plugged in. A Googler said the issue had been passed to the dev team for consideration the very next day. Several days after that, Google said it would be considered for a future Android release. A few more days and the issue was closed with the message ""The requested feature will be available in a future release."" So, Android Q (or maybe even 9.1) should have an option to initiate a backup of your data to Google Drive. The thread does not promise any other new features, so the usefulness will still depend on developers enabling the backup flag. You should at least be able to reliably save your device settings, SMS, and call history via the Drive app. Available in Pie, sort of  It seems Google has lived up to its promise from August. As of Android Pie, code exists to manually trigger backups of app data to Google Drive. XDA managed to activate a ""Back up now"" button in the Backup and Reset menu in Pie. Tap it and you're done. A notification should show you the progress of your backup, or rather it will eventually. The button isn't live for users just yet. On previous versions of Android, you need a computer and ADB access to your phone in order to start the backup. Just use the command adb shell bmgr backupnow --all.  Note: Updated to clarify this feature is not fully live yet. Maybe not Pie?  Tipster Himanshu Singh reports he has the manual backup button in Android 8.1 with no modifications. Meanwhile, Kieron Quinn tells us he enabled the button with a GMS flag change. Again, this is not limited to Pie. It looks like XDA triggered this flag on Pie as the feature was still rolling out, but it's coming to older versions, too. "
Android Police,"Facebook reveals Portal video calling devices, assures public they were 'built with privacy' in mind",10/08/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/08/facebook-portal-video-calling-device/,"  While Facebook's video calling smart home devices have long been in the works, the wake of another major data privacy scandal doesn't feel like the best time for a product launch. But perhaps Facebook just couldn't wait any longer — after all, it was reportedly supposed to debut the new products earlier this year, but held off due to bad press from the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Today, just a little over a week after it announced a security flaw that affected 50 million accounts, the company launched the Portal ($199) and Portal+ ($349), both Amazon Alexa-enabled video calling devices. The Portal has a 10-inch 1280 x 800 pixel display and looks quite similar to the Amazon Echo Show in form factor, while its bigger sibling has a 15-inch 1920 x 1080 pixel display that can pivot on its base and looks more like a tablet mounted on a stand.  Facebook Portal, the smaller of the two. The main selling point of Facebook's first ever hardware devices is that the cameras track action and automatically pan and zoom to keep the subjects of the video in view. The devices also advertise the ability to enhance the voice of whoever is talking, regardless of where they move, while minimizing background noise. Of course, we all know the main detractor from buying either of these devices — Facebook's shaky to downright-inexcusable history with users' data privacy. The company is therefore addressing that issue right off the bat, writing in its announcement that the devices are ""built with privacy + security in mind."" The company goes so far as to ship the Portals with a physical camera cover, and promises that it doesn't ""listen, view, or keep the contents of your Portal video calls."" Plus, the AI tech runs locally, it reports, and the camera doesn't use facial recognition or identify users.  Facebook Portal+. The larger device can also pivot. The only video calling platform the device supports is Messenger, naturally. But the company has collaborated with Amazon to build in Alexa as voice AI, delivering the functionality of an Echo device. Even as these two tech giants team up, though, Facebook has asserted ownership over the device by offering its own voice controls, as well. Users can say ""Hey Portal"" and note who they'd like to call, signalling Facebook may have aspirations for Portal to become a larger AI brand. Further addressing privacy concerns, Facebook promises you can delete Portal's voice history in your Facebook Activity log. In video calls, Facebook is offering integrations with Spotify Premium, Pandora, iHeartRadio, and its own video platform to let users watch or listen to content together on a call. There's also a new ""Story Time"" AR feature for video calls with kids. When video calling is not active, the device can display photos, videos, and notifications like birthday reminders. The Portal and Portal+ are now available for pre-order in the US at Amazon, Best Buy, and portal.facebook.com. For those who are brave enough with their data to purchase two, there's a $100 discount."
Android Police,HP Chromebook x360 14 is a premium convertible costing $599,10/08/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/08/hp-chromebook-x360-14-premium-convertible-costing-599/,"  As Google continues to make Chrome OS more touch-friendly, we're going to see an increasing number of convertible form factors in the space, and that's exactly what HP has announced today. The Chromebook x360 14 is a premium device with a 360-degree rotating hinge allowing for tablet, tent, and stand modes. It includes powerful internals such as 8th generation Intel Core processors (i3 or i5) and 8GB of RAM.   IFA 2018 saw the introduction of $600 Chromebooks from Dell and Lenovo with better than normal specs, and this new model from HP joins its detachable Chromebook x2 in the same price bracket. Not to be confused with the cheap, education-focused Chromebook x360 11, the newest HP model offers a full-size backlit keyboard, Intel UHD Graphics 620, and battery life of up to 13.5 hours (based on mixed usage). The display is an impressive-sounding 14-inch FHD IPS micro-edge WLED-backlit (1920 x 1080) panel with pretty small bezels. HP has only included 64GB of internal storage (eMMC), which is a bit of a disappointment. There is an HD Wide Vision webcam on board, and HP talks up the sleek design and ceramic-like feel. The dimensions are 12.81 in (W) x 8.93 in (D) x 0.63 in (H). USB-C is used for charging (2 ports), and there are also 2 Type-A ports, a MicroSD slot, and a headphone jack. The HP Chromebook x360 14 is available to pre-order today starting at $599. It'll hit stores including Best Buy on October 21st. HP Launches Premium Chromebook x360 Company’s thinnest Chromebook convertible delivers high-end design and versatileperformance Palo Alto, Calif., Oct. 8, 2018 — HP Inc. today announced the HP Chromebook x360 14, HP’s thinnest
Chromebook convertible device for the popular Chrome OS.
As Chromebooks grow in popularity and are increasingly used as a primary device, consumers expect a
similar or even better experience versus a traditional laptop. Based on internal HP research1
, 47 percent of
those surveyed believed the Chrome OS is easy to use, while 60 percent of respondents feel hybrid form
factors are more innovative, fun, and relevant than the traditional clamshell design. Understanding these
insights, HP set out to create an experience that exceeds the demands and expectations of what a
Chromebook should be. “As customers continue to embrace the Chrome ecosystem, we have learned that they are often seeking the
same design and features that make our other convertible devices so popular,” said Kevin Frost, vice
president and general manager, Consumer PCs, HP Inc. “With the success of the HP Chromebook x2 earlier
this year, customers have signalled they want premium choices and powerful experiences in their Chrome
devices. We are excited to expand our Chromebook portfolio with the HP Chromebook x360 14 – an
unparalleled Chrome experience with a head-turning design that delivers the power and performance our
customers expect.” Meticulously Designed to Delight The Chromebook x360 offers a gorgeous, premium design and elegance with 3D stamped metal
keyboard deck and a diamond-cut trim on the touchpad. An Advanced Electrodeposition (AED) application
gives the device’s cover a protective and decorative coating, creating a ceramic-like white finish. In
addition to the beautiful matte design, this maintains the metal characteristic of the Chromebook and
provides additional strength, durability and scratch resistance. Additionally, the anodized aluminum
keyboard deck in cloud blue with color matched keycaps offers subtle premium touches designed to turn
heads. News Release ©Copyright 2018 HP Development Company, L.P. The information contained herein is subject to change without notice. The only warranties for HP

for
enhanced performance. The device comes with up to 64 GB of SSD storage for fast processing and boot
time, and up to 8 GB of DDR4 to multitask with ease. Customers also expect long battery life beyond the
traditional eight-hour day. The Chromebook x360 has up to 14 hours of battery life3
to handle whatever
life throws at you – whether working, playing or binge watching your favorite Netflix series.
Entertainment is an important experience for consumers on their convertible devices, so creating a device
that is visually and audibly amazing was a priority in the development of the Chromebook x360. HP
worked closely with the company’s audio partner Bang & Olufsen to deliver custom tuning of the dual
speakers for a rich, authentic listening experience. For an optimal viewing experience, the device features
a 14-inch diagonal FHD touch display4 with an ultra-thin narrow bezel (7.5 mm). And the Chromebook
x360 also comes with a broad array of ports for connectivity, including 2 USB Type C™, 1 USB Type A 3.1, a
Micro SD port, and Audio jacks (in/out).

Philips produces the Hue line of products, which can perform some rather cool tricks that will make your standard lights envious. For example, they can be programmed to change colors when they detect smoke, or when your favorite sports team scores. We recently linked to a deal on Amazon for new Hue units, but if you're looking for more savings, Woot has refurbished models on sale for a larger discount.   With a range of products on discount, you'll find almost everything you need to get started at Woot. These refurbished units are fully tested for both function and appearance. They also include a 90-day warranty. If you're looking to create a setup for the first time, be sure to consider the Smart Bridge for voice and app control functions so you can connect with Google, Apple, and Amazon smart home setups. Here's how the Woot deals compare with their original, new prices: These deals are good for the next 15 hours, ending at 12 a.m. Central Time. Customers in Hawaii or Alaska are out of luck, however.

Android Police,"Update Notes for Photos, Play Store, Keep Notes, and more (October 8th, 2018)",10/08/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/08/update-notes-photos-play-store-keep-notes-october-8th-2018/," Article Contents  Every week, I examine somewhere in the neighborhood of a hundred app updates while looking for changes. The most interesting things turn into APK Teardowns or Download posts. Many of the remaining updates are unremarkable, amounting to a few bug fixes, routine updates to libraries, or even just pixel-level adjustments to layouts and images. However, there are usually a few updates that land somewhere in between. I don't want to spam readers with dozens of short posts, but I hate to ignore things that people might want to know about, so I'm going to wrap up the leftovers for a little weekend reading and call it Update Notes. Special thanks to נתנאל מ for the great hero image on this post! Surprisingly, the 4.2 update landed with virtually no sign of change, save one. The RAW recommendation feature is now live, even if it's not the most exciting change.  The RAW editor suggestions appeared in the v4.1 teardown. Now, if you are viewing a RAW image and tap the button to make edits, you'll see an Edit In card pop up. The top entry will be Photos, but it has a small line of warning to explain that it has limited support for RAW. This is followed by other image editors on the device, and then an entry at the bottom that links to a custom Play Store list containing more RAW editors.  Despite bumping the major version number to 12, the latest update doesn't appear to have made any revolutionary changes to the look or experience in the Play Store. I'm inclined to assume the team simply prefered to carry the one rather than ship a v11.10. Nevertheless, there are still a couple of things of interest in the last two updates. Play Protect is effectively Google's version of a virus scanner for Android. Sideloading remains plenty common, and since there's a danger that malware-laden apps might be spreading, Google is raising the stakes to track down unsavory APKs. There's text for a new prompt asking users to submit unfamiliar apps to Play Protect for further scanning. This doesn't read like a prompt for simply scanning apps locally, I'm pretty certain this is intended to transfer APKs back to Google for a more thorough analysis. In general, this is a pretty good thing, though I can imagine some degree of privacy concerns. I'm just curious if this will attempt to send back beta builds of apps that are handed out separately from the Play Store, or even just developer builds.  There is a very minor change the organization of permissions in v12. A new group for the Call Log was added, and naturally, read and write permissions were moved into it from the Phone group. It looks like there may be a recommendation dialog popping up to recommend tablet-optimized apps if you already had them installed on other devices. Basically, the Play Store will look at the apps you already own and make them more visible if you are using a tablet or some other device with a larger screen (e.g. a Chromebook).  With Inbox inevitably shutting down in the future, all eyes are on Gmail to be the one size fits all email app. You're not going to find anything too significant in the last few updates, but there's at least one familiar feature preparing to make its mobile debut: Smart Compose. If you've used the web interface for Gmail in the last few months, you already know about Smart Compose. It basically tries to write emails for you. For fast typists, it might save you a couple of seconds from time to time, but it's great for anybody that has to hunt and peck at the keyboard. But think of how much more useful it would be on smartphones where the keyboard experience isn't wonderful for anybody. That will be happening... soon? There are a few lines for the setting that enables/disables Smart Compose. Judging by the location of the toggle, it seems likely that it will be enabled on a per-account basis.  Sometimes it's the little things that matter.  Left: v5.0.331. Right: 5.0.371. Google Keep used to title its widgets as just ""Google Keep."" The latest version has replaced that name with descriptive titles that actually mean something to the widgets. They are now called Note List and Quick Capture.  The latest Google+ update continues a trend of adding quite a bit behind the scenes for what is obviously a major update to the social network. But unlike those last few releases, this one is promising a somewhat more mundane update to the moderation tools for communities. There's a very large number of new strings and other resources related to community moderation. The content below is largely centered around approving posts, banning members, and handling requests. Of course, these things already exist in the current interface, but such a large addition likely suggests the interface will be changing, hopefully to make it more streamlined and convenient to use on mobile. <activity android:name=""com.google.android.apps.plus.squares.moderation.SquareModerationActivity"" android:exported=""false"" android:launchMode=""singleTop"" android:logo=""@drawable/actionbar_gplus_logo"" android:theme=""@style/Theme.Square.NoActionBar"" /> <string name=""approve_positive_button"">Approve</string><string name=""approve_posts_positive_button"">Approve</string><string name=""ban_positive_button"">Ban</string><string name=""reject_positive_button"">Reject</string><string name=""reject_posts_positive_button"">Reject</string><string name=""selection_moderation_title_people"">Select people…</string><string name=""selection_moderation_title_posts"">Select posts…</string><string name=""select"">Select</string><string name=""square_approve_post_error"">Can\'t approve post.</string><string name=""square_bulk_actions_dialog_message"">You can\'t undo this action</string><string name=""square_bulk_post_moderation_ban_failure"">Can\'t ban member.</string><string name=""square_bulk_post_moderation_banned"">Banned</string><string name=""square_bulk_post_moderation_dialog_message"">You can\'t undo this action</string><string name=""square_bulk_post_moderation_progress_dialog"">Sending…</string><string name=""square_moderation_approve_failure"">Can\'t approve request to join.</string><string name=""square_moderation_approved"">Approved</string><string name=""square_moderation_approving"">Approving…</string><string name=""square_moderation_ban_failure"">Can\'t ban member.</string><string name=""square_moderation_banned"">Banned</string><string name=""square_moderation_banning"">Banning…</string><string name=""square_moderation_reject_failure"">Can\'t reject request to join</string><string name=""square_moderation_rejected"">Rejected</string><string name=""square_moderation_rejecting"">Rejecting…</string><string name=""square_post_moderation_ban_failure"">Can\'t ban member.</string><string name=""square_post_moderation_banned"">Banned</string><string name=""square_post_moderation_progress_dialog"">Sending…</string><string name=""square_post_rejected_message"">Post rejected</string><string name=""square_reject_post_error"">Can\'t reject post.</string> <plurals name=""selection_moderation_title_number_selected""><item>%d selected</item><item>%d selected</item></plurals><plurals name=""square_approve_multiple_posts_dialog_title""><item>Approve %d posts?</item><item>Approve %d post?</item></plurals><plurals name=""square_approve_multiple_requests_dialog_title""><item>Approve %d requests?</item><item>Approve %d request?</item></plurals><plurals name=""square_ban_multiple_post_authors_dialog_title""><item>Ban %d users?</item><item>Ban %d user?</item></plurals><plurals name=""square_ban_multiple_users_dialog_title""><item>Ban %d users?</item><item>Ban %d user?</item></plurals><plurals name=""square_reject_multiple_posts_dialog_title""><item>Reject %d posts?</item><item>Reject %d post?</item></plurals><plurals name=""square_reject_multiple_requests_dialog_title""><item>Reject %d requests?</item><item>Reject %d request?</item></plurals><plurals name=""view_all_comments_button_title""><item>show all %d comments</item><item>show %d comment</item></plurals> layout/ban_author_dialog.xml

There are a few things worth checking out. I can't say that I've ever heard of it, but it looks like support for Thomas Transit is in the plans. Now that Google Pay and Google Pay Send (formerly Google Wallet) are fully merged, it's time for new features. Now there appears to be a QR code money transfer in development that would allow users to send money to each other by just scanning a code on the other person's phone. No real details are exposed beyond the fact that this is peer-to-peer and not a way to make payments at businesses. Aside from that, it's not really clear if there are limits to how much can be sent, to whom, and if there are any other terms. Alright, this name has been plaguing me for the better part of a year. I've been aware of the ""thermo"" name roughly since December, and a few weeks ago I thought there was enough to at least begin discussing it, but it wasn't until the v2.75 update that I got the one clue that finally explained what it actually is. In short, it's a South Korean payment method that appears to be useful for both purchases and mass transit. This was finally explained thanks to the presence of the South Korean word for Won on a line that mentions a fee for switching cards. Google Pay is expanding to cover more financial scenarios, and one that's on the list is a discount for people that are under a certain age. The interface asks for a birth date, but otherwise doesn't explain how or if any meaningful verifications are taking place. "
Android Police,Google's revamped Safety Center comes to Europe,10/08/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/08/googles-revamped-safety-center-comes-europe/,"  Last month, Google redesigned its Safety Center and added further resources to help you stay safe online. It details important privacy controls and offers tons of tips for protecting you and your family as they surf the web. Google promised to roll it out in 65 languages in the coming weeks, and now it's arrived in six European countries.  From today, users in the UK, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands will be able to access the updated Safety Center. It's a timely launch considering it's currently European Cyber Security Month. As well as teaching you about Google tools such as Privacy Checkup and My Activity, the Safety Center also links to external resources and organizations dealing with issues such as cyberbullying and child online safety. Google says that the rollout will extend to even more countries soon. The company is also committed to evolving the tools and information within the Safety Center as time goes by. You can check it out by visiting safety.google."
Android Police,What to expect from Google's launch event tomorrow,10/08/18,https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/08/expect-googles-launch-event-tomorrow/," Article Contents  Google's yearly hardware event is nearly upon us. In this day and age, there are always bits of information leaked ahead of official announcements, but this event is completely different. Google has been as leaky as the Titanic over the past few months, so there's a good chance there aren't any surprises left. If you've been living under a rock this whole time, or you haven't been able to keep track of all the leaks, we've summarized everything we know about the products Google will (probably) announce tomorrow. It's safe to say that none of Google's products have been spoiled like the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL. Beyond the usual press renders and wild sightings, a number of stolen Pixel 3 XL units ended up in the hands of bloggers. There are no surprises left about the two phones.  From Engadget's early hands-on video, we know the Pixel 3 XL has a Snapdragon 845 processor, 4GB RAM, a 12.2MP rear camera, two 8MP front cameras (one of which is a wide-angle lens), a 2960x1440 OLED screen, and Android 9 Pie. The main camera can record 4K at 30FPS, while the selfie cameras are limited to 1080p.  The Pixel 3/3XL in black, white, and ""Sand"" (source) There have been fewer leaks of the smaller Pixel 3, but going by previous Pixel phones, the hardware will be nearly identical. It's safe to assume it will have the same Snapdragon 845 processor and 4GB RAM, and renders show the same dual front cameras on both devices. Both phones will work on CDMA and GSM networks. FCC filings mentioned the full list of supported frequencies, which includes T-Mobile's new 'Extended Range LTE' - Band 12 (700MHz) and Band 71 (600MHz). Those documents also revealed that both devices will support wireless charging - something that has been absent from Google's phones since the Nexus 5X and 6P. The software probably won't be much of a surprise, as existing hands-on footage shows the same stock Android 9 Pie experience that current Pixels have. New live wallpapers are included, which are already available for download. Google is finally returning to the tablet market, but not with an Android-based product. The 'Pixel Slate,' as it's called, is the company's first Chrome OS tablet. It has a 3:2 2400×1600 display with stylus support, stereo front-facing speakers, and cameras on the front and back.  There's also a detachable keyboard, which doubles as a folio case when the Pixel Slate is not in use. While the dedicated Assistant key isn't anything new, the typewriter-like rounded keys are. It's not clear if the keyboard will be included, or if it must be purchased separately (like with the keyboards for Microsoft's Surface tablets).  There will probably be multiple hardware variants available, with at least some of them using Intel Kaby Lake processors. All of them will have the Play Store, and Linux app support is likely. The Pixel Slate probably won't be the only new Chrome OS device announced tomorrow - there's a good chance that last year's Pixelbook will get a refresh. There haven't been any credible images of the new device yet, but the main changes will likely be smaller screen bezels and internal hardware upgrades.  A device with the codename 'Atlas', which is believed to be an upgraded Pixelbook, has appeared multiple times in the Chromium source code. One commit reveals that Atlas has a 3840x2160 display, which is a substantial improvement from the Pixelbook's 2400x1600 screen. Out of all the products that will most likely be announced tomorrow, the Pixelbook 2 is definitely the one we know the least about. Last year's model received mostly-positive reviews, so Google doesn't have to change it much. The first 'smart displays' with Google Assistant arrived earlier this year, including models from JBL and Lenovo. Google will probably announce its own smart display tomorrow, named the 'Google Home Hub'. It looks more like a point-of-sale system than something that belongs in your home, but on the bright side, it will probably be cheap - around $150.  All smart displays with Assistant are functionally identical - they can respond to voice commands just like a Google Home, while also displaying helpful information (like maps, recipe instructions, song lyrics, etc) on the large screen. The existing displays from JBL and Lenovo have front-facing cameras for video calls, but there is no such camera on the Home Hub. The entire unit only weighs 480g, which is only slightly heavier than the original Google Home - that probably means the speakers aren't very powerful. As previously mentioned, the Pixel 3 and 3XL will be the first Google phones with wireless charging since the Nexus 6. Google is also making a wireless charging dock to go with the new phones, fittingly named the 'Pixel Stand'.  You'll be able to charge your Pixel 3 (or presumably any other phone with Qi wireless charging) just by setting it on top of the dock. A special interface will appear while the phone is docked, turning it into a something like an Assistant smart display. Last month, an updated Chromecast with Bluetooth and (possibly) improved Wi-Fi reception was certified by the FCC. We found out what the device looked like a few days ago, not because of leaks, but because Best Buy started selling it to customers.  The third-generation Chromecast has the same puck-shaped design as the current model, but the glossy plastic has been replaced by a subtle matte finish. The large Chrome logo is also gone - the only branding is a small 'G' icon. The magnetic latch on the HDMI connectors has also been removed, but I doubt many people used that in the first place. We can't tell what functional changes there are yet, since the new Chromecast cannot be set up with the current Google Home app. However, we do know that the device will be sold in a 'Smart TV kit', which also includes a Google Home Mini. Finally, there are a few other announcements that might happen at tomorrow's Google event:"
Apple Insider,"Microsoft axes Minecraft for Apple TV, no one notices",10/09/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/10/microsoft-axes-minecraft-for-apple-tv-no-one-notices,"Microsoft is throwing in the towel on the Apple TV permutation of Minecraft due to low user numbers, according to a splash screen that — ironically — has been displayed in-game for weeks without mention from mainstream media.
Microsoft ceased support for Minecraft on the Apple TV on Sept. 24, though users are still able to play the game for the foreseeable future. Users can continue to explore the virtual world and use in-app purchases, Microsoft said.
""We're grateful to the Apple TV community for their support, but we need to reallocate resources to the platforms that our players use the most,"" the splash screen reads.
That Minecraft lacked a vibrant player base shouldn't come as a huge surprise. The pop-up alert presumably appeared weeks ago, yet news of the game's discontinuation is only now making its way to media outlets.
Minecraft's demise is another nail in the coffin for Apple TV's gaming potential. That one of the world's most popular titles was unable to gain traction on Apple TV speaks volumes about the platform and its user base.
Some have criticized Apple for its inability to successfully market Apple TV as a casual gaming console. 
When the fourth-generation Apple TV initially launched, Apple required all games support the Siri Remote as well as optional MFi controllers. This policy made it exceedingly difficult for developers to bring more complex games to tvOS, as the Siri Remote is severely limiting and even a bit slow.
Apple changed course and dropped the Siri Remote requirement in 2016, but AAA developers continue to shy away from the platform. 
Gaming was never a major selling point for Apple TV, and Apple is seemingly content to let those prospects wither as it shifts focus back to video apps and a rumored first-party streaming service.
Minecraft remains available for iPhone, iPad, and Mac."
Apple Insider,Apple seemingly aware of alleged 'Top Podcasts' chart manipulation,10/09/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/09/apple-seemingly-aware-of-alleged-top-podcasts-chart-manipulation,"Last weekend, the upper echelons of Apple's ""Top Podcasts"" charts in the Podcasts app and iTunes were overrun with obscure titles that seemingly didn't belong, prompting some industry watchers to assume the vital distribution platform was being manipulated. 
In light of the incongruity, and a history of similar problems, podcasters and others associated with the medium took to social media to voice concerns that outside parties were cooking Apple's important charts. 
As noted by Business Insider, Apple does not host individual podcasts, at least those not published by company, but it does play a vital role in helping content makers find listeners. 
From iPod —  podcasting's namesake —  to the Podcasts app for iOS and iTunes Store, Apple plays an outsized role in steering listener tastes. 
What the App Store's genre-specific top charts does for apps, so does the ""Top Podcasts"" chart do for free, typically episodic, audio content. The effect is perhaps more pronounced with podcasts, as many listeners rely solely on Apple's charts and discovery features to surface new shows.
For podcasters who make a living off advertising or podcast sponsorships, the platform is vital to their well-being. 
While industry stalwarts like ""Serial,"" ""Lore"" and ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" routinely rank in the top-five of Apple's charts, the largely static landscape was clearly disrupted over the weekend. Real estate-themed podcast ""Bulletproof Real Estate With Andy Dane Carter"" sat in the top spot for some time, while other shows shot up to occupy coveted high-rated seats, Business Insider reports. 
The chart reverted back to situation normal on Tuesday —  ""Bulletproof Real Estate With Andy Dane Carter"" was sitting at No. 91 as of this writing —  suggesting Apple is aware of the situation and has taken action. 
The abrupt change caught the eye of industry watchers like Dave Zohrob, whose firm Chartable provides podcasters with data and analytics across a variety of top podcasting platforms. 
""We've been doing our own digging into the charts and have seen a highly unusual amount of manipulation in recent days,"" Zohrob told the publication.
Zohrob and others believe Apple's charts are easily manipulated by unscrupulous publishers. In particular, podcasters looking for an extra boost can buy the services of ""click farms"" that use bogus iTunes accounts to falsely inflate listener numbers. Online marketplace Fiverr, as well as other outlets like Twitter, feature users promising to push podcasts into the top 20 or top 10 of Apple's charts for a nominal fee. 
""[I]t's easier now than ever before. for ~$50 there are 20+ fiverr [sic] accounts willing to get you into the top 20,"" Kevin Goldberg of Discover Pods said in a tweet. 
In an investigation into podcast chart manipulation earlier this year, Goldberg cast doubt on the click farm theory, noting many of the services exist outside of the U.S. and would thus not impact domestic podcast rankings. Goldberg believes a more effective method would be the creation of Apple IDs, perhaps through an automated script, and subsequent subscription to a desired podcast.  
Therein lies the crux of gaming Apple's charts. While the company has not revealed the methodology behind its rankings, those who monitor Apple's charts believe subscription numbers outweigh individual listens. The system dissuades boost-by-click, but is by no means infallible.  
Working off the premise that Apple charts rely — largely — on subscription-weighted rankings, a quick look at metrics can quickly reveal anomalies. For example, a spreadsheet shared by Zohrob demonstrates a number of shows reached high ranks over the weekend despite lacking user reviews or Top-400 episodes. Additionally, some podcasts that failed to release a new episode ""in weeks"" recently shot up Apple's charts, Zohrob said. 
Goldberg summarized segment sentiment on the issue in a tweet last week.
""Podcasters, please stop using these charts as validation. Advertisers, don't base you rates on chart rankings. Listeners, there are tons of great podcasts out there, don't rely on these charts,"" he said."
Apple Insider,Apple's dual-camera iPhones subject of new patent lawsuit,10/09/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/09/apples-dual-camera-iphones-subject-of-new-patent-lawsuit,"A lawsuit filed Tuesday claims Apple's dual-camera iPhone technology, deployed in smartphone models dating back to iPhone 7 Plus, infringes on a patent for enhancing digital photographic images using multiple lenses and sensors. 
Filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, the suit names plaintiffs Yanbin Yu and Zhongxuan Zhang, who allege Apple's dual-camera solution is in infringement of a noted invention the pair developed in 1999. 
U.S. Patent No. 6,611,289 for ""Digital cameras using multiple sensors with multiple lenses"" details methods for improving the quality of digital photographs. 
The patent, granted in 2003, describes techniques for capturing multiple images with multiple camera lens and sensor arrays. Up to four cooperative camera arrays are supported by the filing's claims, and indeed the patent focuses of a four-camera mechanism that merges images pulled from monochromatic sensors into a single multi-color image. 
At least five patent claims deal specifically with a dual-lens layout in which two cameras are placed in close proximity —  along a common plane —  to capture distinct ""intensity images,"" one of which is used to enhance the other. 
According to the complaint, and echoed in the patent abstract, both sensors are capable of capturing full-color images. Underlying circuitry includes analog-to-digital converters, one each for the two sensors, that independently digitize incoming information in parallel. An image signal processor combines a first full-color image with portions of the second captured image to create an enhanced final product. 
Yu and Zhang allege Apple's iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max infringe on the '289 patent. All handsets feature rear-facing dual-camera arrays with both wide-angle and telephoto lenses used to produce Portrait Mode, Portrait Lighting and digital zoom photos. Apple's iPhone X and XS series devices go further with Portrait Mode and Lighting selfie photo capabilities powered by the TrueDepth camera system.
Apple filed its own patent for a multi-sensor camera system in 2008 with U.S. Patent No. 8,115,825 for an ""Electronic device with two image sensors."" The IP, granted in 2012, sought to claim ""many of the same features"" as the '289 patent, the complaint alleges. 
Apple was made aware of the '289 property as early as 2011, the complaint claims. That year, a patent examiner issued an office action rejecting 11 claims of what would become the '825 patent as anticipated, or not novel, in relation to Yu and Zhang's IP. Remaining claims were rejected as obvious in light of the '289 patent and other prior art. 
Approximately three months after the initial rejection, an unnamed Apple patent attorney contacted the patent examiner to discuss amendments to the claims in hopes of gaining U.S. Patent and Trademark Office allowance. A day later, Apple filed a revised version of the IP with limitations and additions to existing claims, arguing the modifications overcome the '289 patent, the complaint reads.   
Further, Apple cited the '289 patent in gaining a grant of U.S. Patent No. 8,681,250, itself a continuation of the same patent application that birthed the '825 patent.
Plaintiffs in the case note Apple invested substantial capital to realize its multi-sensor camera vision, citing the acquisitions of Israeli 3D sensor specialist PrimeSense in 2013 and camera technology company  LinX Imaging in 2015. Despite those purchases, Apple did not seek to license the '289 patent and went on to market various iPhone models with knowledge that its technology infringes on the property, according to the complaint. 
Yu and Zhang seek damages with the option to treble due to ""willful, wanton, deliberate and egregious"" infringement and attorneys' fees in their lawsuit."
Apple Insider,Popular farming RPG Stardew Valley breaks soil on iPhones & iPads Oct. 24,10/09/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/09/popular-farming-rpg-stardew-valley-breaks-soil-on-iphones-ipads-oct-24,"Farming-themed role-playing game Stardew Valley, already a hit on consoles and PCs, is launching on iPhone and iPad Oct. 24, developer ConcernedApe (Eric Barone) revealed on Tuesday.
Unlike many iOS ports, Stardew Valley is making a transition in full, with most major features and content intact. 
The one exception is co-op multiplayer, a relatively recent addition on other platforms. PC players will even be able to migrate their saves to iOS using the file transfer feature in iTunes, as long as they come from an un-modded version of the game. 
To accommodate mobile devices, controls and menus have been redesigned for touchscreens.
The plot of the game sees the protagonist inheriting their grandfather's farm, which they can then improve and expand. Players can also fish and raise livestock, and fight various creatures as they explore local caves. 30 residents are available to interact with in Pelican Town — some of whom can be courted and married, including same-sex relationships.
Preorders for the iOS port begin today. The game costs $7.99, and requires iOS 10 or later."
Apple Insider,Jony Ive disappears from list of advisors for Saudi 'megacity' project [u],10/09/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/09/jony-ive-disappears-from-list-of-advisors-for-saudi-megacity-project,"Apple's chief design officer, Jony Ive, has vanished from a list of advisors for a ""megacity"" planned to launch in Saudi Arabia in 2025. [Updated with correction on NEOM's size]
Ive was removed from the list on Tuesday after a brief appearance, and Apple has confirmed that Ive isn't involved in the project, according to BuzzFeed News' Tom Gara. It's not clear why Ive's name was on the roster in the first place.
A number of other prominent figures are still mentioned, such as Andreessen Horowitz co-founder Marc Andreessen, Foster + Partners CEO Norman Foster, former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, and SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son.
The megacity project, known as NEOM, was originally announced by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman in October 2017. It's expected to cost some $500 billion, and cover 26,500 square kilometers in northwestern Saudi Arabia, extending into Egypt and Jordan. Only the first phase should be ready in 2025.
Ive is one of the most famous product designers in the world, thanks to work on devices like Macs, iPods, iPhones, and iPads. He has also had some involvement in Apple architecture, contributing to Apple stores and even the company's new Apple Park headquarters in Cupertino.
The designer could have conceivably applied his minimalist aesthetic to NEOM buildings and helped direct the use of technology in the city."
Apple Insider,Supermicro iCloud spy chip report bolstered by US telecom network hardware hack,10/09/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/09/supermicro-icloud-spy-chip-report-bolstered-by-us-telecom-network-hardware-hack,"Bloomberg is doubling down on its investigative report claiming servers belonging to Apple, Amazon, and other major organizations were tampered by China, by citing documents and analysis from a security expert working for a major telecommunications firm. 
The latest allegations stem from Sepio Systems chief Yossi Appleboum, whose firm was hired to scan several large data centers belonging to an unidentified customer. The company in question is not revealed, under claims it would break Appleboum's nondisclosure agreement with the customer. 
According to Bloomberg's latest report, ""unusual communications from a Supermicro server"" prompted a physical inspection, which in turn revealed an implant in the Ethernet connector. Appleboum claims he had seen similar things happen to a variety of computer hardware produced under contract in China, and not just Supermicro products. 
""Supermicro is a victim - so is everyone else,"" Appleboum claims, adding concern that there are many points in the supply chain in China where such alterations to products could be made, and that finding where it took place is practically impossible. ""That's the problem with the Chinese supply chain,"" the executive stressed. 
According to Appleboum, the telecom company's server was modified in the factory where it was produced, with Western intelligence contacts advising it was made at a Supermicro subcontractor in Guangzhou, southeastern China. The telecoms facility allegedly housed a large number of Supermicro servers, and technicians could not say what kind of data was moving through the infected server. It is also unknown if the FBI was informed by the client. 
AT&T spokesman Fletcher Cook advised to the report ""These devices are not part of our network, and we are not affected."" A similar ""not affected"" statement was received from Verizon, while T-Mobile and Sprint did not respond to comment requests. 
This report is the first with a named source. The report also does note that this vector of attack differs from Bloomberg's account.
""The security of our customers and the integrity of our products are core to our business and our company values,"" said Supermicro in a statement to the report. ""We take care to secure the integrity of our products throughout the manufacturing process, and supply chain security is an important topic of discussion for our industry."" 
""We still have no knowledge of any unauthorized components and have not been informed by any customer that such components have been found,"" the statement continued, before claiming to be ""dismayed"" by Bloomberg providing ""only limited information, no documentation, and half a day to respond"" to the new allegations. 
Supposedly designed by the Chinese military, the chip is claimed to act as a ""stealth doorway onto any network,"" and offered ""long-term stealth access"" to attached computer systems. The original Bloomberg report has since been denied by many of the companies identified in the article, including a strong denial from Apple characterizing the report as ""wrong and misinformed."" 
Apple has also reportedly performed a ""massive, granular, and siloed investigation"" into claims leveled in the report, but failed to find any evidence of hardware tampering or to identify unrelated incidents that could have contributed to the claims. Apple has since written to the U.S. Congress on the matter, insisting there is a lack of evidence. 
The Department of Homeland Security has chimed in, alongside the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, both cast doubt on the report. Other U.S. officials are also uncertain of the report's accuracy, with one official changing their stance from their original suggestion the ""thrust of the article"" was true. 
One of the few named sources in the original report has also revealed doubts over the veracity of the story, including dealings with journalist Jordan Robertson, one of the Bloomberg report's authors. Security researcher Joe Fitzpatrick advised on Monday he had discussed proof-of-concept devices he had demonstrated at Black Hat 2016, but found it strange that ideas he mentioned were confirmed to the publication by other sources."

Speaking to unidentified sources of Apple, The Information claims Apple saw significant amounts of fraud in the country relating to warranty repairs. In May 2013, the Apple Store in Shenzhen had logged more than 2,000 warranty claims per week, which was the highest of all Apple retail outlets in the world. 
Apple's investigation discovered the high rate was caused by a sophisticated and organized scheme, where thieves would buy or steal iPhones, remove valuable components including the processor, screen, and logic board, and replace them with fake parts or other items, including chewing gum wrappers. 
The thieves then returned the iPhones to the store, claiming they were broken, and received replacements that were then resold. The extracted components were then used to refurbish iPhones in other smaller Chinese cities. 
The fraudsters are claimed to have stood outside stores with ""suitcases full of iPhones"" that had been stripped of components, and attempt to hire people to pretend to be customers to return the devices at the Genius Bar. After the iPhones were replaced, the hired participants would hand the replacement back to the criminal and receive their pay. 
Shenzhen was the venue for most of the criminal schemes, in part because of the existing criminal operations in the city, as well as its proximity to Hong Kong. The Huaqiangbei electronics market is located in Shenzhen, and is thought to be the main destination for the purloined iPhone parts. 
Initial policy followed as with replacements in the U.S., in that store employees would swap the iPhones if there were no signs of intentional damage. At the time, it was estimated that 10 percent of warranty claims were fraudulent, based on anecdotal evidence. 
In 2013, an Apple data scientist started to monitor the number of iPhones that would switch to a new Apple ID following a warranty replacement, as a way to check for fraud due to legitimate replacements usually using the most recently used Apple ID. It was found that more than 60 percent of replaced iPhones in China were using a new ID. 
An internal fraud methodology known as Mismatch was adopted, using 300 employees fighting the problem, which had ballooned in size. While Apple had set aside $1.6 billion at the start of the 2013 fiscal year to handle global warranty claims, the amount spent ended up being $3.7 billion, with China said to be a significant contributor. 
The first step to reduce fraud was the addition of a reservation system that also required proof of ownership, but the system was then swarmed by hackers who managed to fill up all of the available time slots instead of allowing legitimate customers access. Diagnostic software was also created to help retail employees detect fake parts without needing to disassemble the hardware, but again this was thwarted by fraudsters simply disabling iPhones to a point where they would not turn on at all. 
The fraudsters also obtained customer records and serial numbers for iPhones that had already been sold in China, configuring the returning iPhones with the stolen serials, and even etching the numbers on back covers. Apple then developed another screening method which checked if serial numbers of submitted devices are already being used with Apple's online services on other iPhones. 
As it became harder to illegally gain replacements the criminals coerced and bribed Apple retail employees, including threatening one Chengdu manager with a cattle prod. 
Apple later stopped performing in-store replacements, instead requiring the devices to be sent to distribution and repair centers for inspection. A space was set up with assembly partner Pegatron to test suspicious devices, but the high numbers of devices forced the creation of four other screening centers. 
By 2016, fraud claims had reduced down to between 30 percent and 50 percent of all warranty claims, depending on the model. By contrast, fraud claims in the U.S. ranged between 5 percent and 10 percent of all claims. 
Apple has also made changes to the supply chain to ward off attempts at component theft, such as dipping batteries in a special dye visible under high frequency light, following the theft of a large batch of batteries. Processors are also coated with a waterproof sealant, again visible under certain light wavelengths, as another theft countermeasure. 
It is claimed that initial attempts to fend off fraud were restricted due to the secretive work culture of the company, where different departments worked separately with little co-operation. After Apple CEO Tim Cook was briefed on the extent of the problem, he was said to be on board with tackling the issue and making progress to cut fraud. 
Fraud is still a problem for the company, with attention shifting to other countries where Apple has a presence. Fraudsters are apparently setting up shop in the United Arab Emirates and Turkey, though at this time it is unknown how much of a problem the crime could be to the company in those markets. 
In China, the fraud effort appears to be working, with overall repair fraud now making up 20 percent of claims. Apple's warranty expenses also declined for the first time since the iPhone's release in 2017, dropping to $4.32 billion from $4.66 billion the previous year."
Apple Insider,"CBC Video claims Apple's repair policies are abusive, but 'proof' falls far short",10/09/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/09/cbc-video-claims-apples-repair-policies-are-abusive-but-proof-falls-far-short,"A report from the CBC has attacked Apple's policies and practices regarding repairs, taking the company to task for expensive in-store repairs, coercing customers to buy new products in some cases —but the publication shows a stunning lack of understanding of the scale of Apple's repair efforts, and leans too heavily on edge cases presented by a pair of respected ""right to repair"" proponents rather than actual observation.
The story from CBC's The National starts with an undercover sting on one Toronto Apple Store, with a ""common problem"" where the screen wasn't working properly. On inspection by one of the store's Geniuses, it was noted ""there is a lot of liquid that's gotten on the inside,"" as water ingress indicator dots colored red confirming there to be water ingress. 
The indicators led the Genius to advise the customer would ""need to be looking at replacing quite a few components"" due to the inferred damage. When pressed if it could be something else, the customer was advised that, ""regardless of what the cause of it is,"" the liquid damage would have to be rectified as a priority, and that the store ""can't do partial repairs when it's been damaged by something."" 
In terms of their options, the store employee advised it would cost a minimum of $1,200, with $600 and $500 quoted to replace the logic board and top case and $100 labor. If the display needs replacement, that would cost an extra $780. 
When further pressed if there was a way to make it cheaper, the Genius advised the fee ""is very close to the cost of buying a new computer. In terms of fixing it in the store? No.""
The same MacBook Pro was taken to prominent YouTube repair personality and repair shop owner Louis Rossmann, who saw the same indicators in his inspection, but dismissed them as confirmation of immersion or liquid damage due to potentially being triggered by humidity. After discovering the display worked, but without a backlight, a bent pin in a display connector was found to be at fault, which was then pressed back in place as a repair within a few minutes. 
Rossmann claims he could've provided a customer the repair for free as a short-term solution, one he believes would last for the remaining lifetime of the computer in the majority of cases. If the customer wanted a replacement cable as a longer-term solution, Rossmann estimates the cost to be between $75 and $150. 
When queried how often customers turn up at his store after the Apple Store declines a repair or says it's too expensive to fix, Rossmann suggests it happens ""somewhere between 10 and 30 times a day.""
The report asked Apple to respond to this incident and allegations on the expensive repairs. A statement from Apple claims customers are best-served by ""certified experts using genuine parts,"" and denies systematically overestimating the cost of repairs. 
Repair outfit iFixit, known for its teardowns of Apple products and supply of support documents, parts, and tools was also featured in the video. Kyle Wiens, owner and spokesman for the national Right to Repair movement, advised it is ""increasingly more challenging to get access to the information that you need, or for local shops to get the parts"" for a repair, with the movement pushing for legislation to restore the ability for consumers to perform repairs. 
""Apple's perspective is that it wants complete control over the device, from the moment that you buy it, all the way through to the end of life,"" asserts Wiens. ""Right to Repair takes some of the control away from them, and puts it back into the hands of the owner. That's where for manufacturers to say 'we're making a product, putting it out in the world, and we'll control every aspect of what happens after the fact,' is complete lunacy."" 
Wiens goes on to show some of Apple's security practices to make it harder to repair products, including pentalobe screws and gluing batteries in place in an iPhone. 
Repairing the Home button on an iOS device was previously considered an easy repair, the report claims, until Apple ""reprogrammed its operating system to detect non-authorized Home buttons, and the phone would suddenly stop working."" Without mentioning that the Home button also contains Touch ID and interfaces with Apple's Secure Enclave, Wiens likens it to putting aftermarket tires on a Tesla, then Tesla shipping a software update that would stop the car from working with those specific tires. 
It ""stems from a mentality that they are the center of the universe, and nobody is doing anything with their product,"" according to Wiens. 
Apple is claimed to have sent legal threats to third parties who have published internal schematics and other documentation on its products, citing copyright infringement on the manuals, articles, and illustrations used for repairs. Threats of fines of up to $150,000 are noted, in a bid to get the shared information taken down. 
The story then moves to the existence of Right to Repair legislation that would force Apple and others to provide manuals and other items, to aid in fixing problems with hardware. Campaigners believe that one state agreeing to introduce Right to Repair legislation would break the dam, with other states likely to follow suit in demanding manufacturers offer the resources to third parties. 
Rossmann and iFixit have some legitimate points. CBC, on the other hand, does not.Over-simplification of a complicated issue
The implication of the CBC video is that Apple takes the equipment that it gets back from customers and tosses it in a woodchipper, or feeds it to the Liam robot. This isn't the case, though.
Machines that are not captured by engineering for an evaluation of what went wrong are sent back to the depot for either repair and an ultimate destination of the refurbished device supply chain, or scavenging for parts which are then refurbished for other repairs. And yes, the refurbishment process uses people like Rossmann to make those repairs.
The iFixit organization is incredibly good at what they do, like partially dialing back the panic about the screen calibration software requirements for the T2-equipped MacBook Pro and iMac Pro —but they do have to make money somehow. The company makes a living by selling repair parts and tools. They shouldn't be begrudged this of course, and more than one AppleInsider staffer has tools that they purchased from the vendor, obtained parts for repairs from the company, or both.
Rossmann is also very talented at his work, and is incredibly successful. We have sent people emailing us about a difficult or expensive repair to his shop to get a second opinion. But, the CBC's implication that Apple should source repair technicians at each store with that level of talent is ludicrous, and if Apple did it, it would remove any economy of scale that the company holds by using a depot for component-level repair.Service by the numbers
In the last five complete fiscal years, Apple has sold approximately 1.36 billion devices. If you assume that one in a hundred of all of those devices fail from reasons other than user-induced damage like a broken screen per annum, that leaves 13.6 million failures per year. That one in a hundred is less than half the industry standard of 2.5 percent for high-end gear after the initial 30-day infant failure period spanning through the first year of a device's life, and one fifth the failure rate after that year.
If you assume that there are 5000 authorized repair centers —about 10 times the amount of Apple Stores at present —that leaves a very conservatively low estimate of 27,000 devices per year per location that need to be serviced beyond a software reinstall. This doesn't include smashed screens, replacement batteries, or other user-induced damage which according to data collected by AppleInsider, is about triple what a shop sees for failures with no known cause, even before Apple's discounted battery replacement program was put into place.
Like it or not, Apple is a consumer electronics business. Board-level repairs at retail locations are far, far quicker for the company, require less-skilled workers at retail which can be paid less than a Rossmann-level technician, and all of this combined can get a functional machine back to a consumer faster.
As an exercise for the reader, hang out at an Apple store on any given Saturday near the Genius Bar evaluation table, and see how many customers demand instant repair or head-of-the-queue privileges because they have a deadline, Billy's birthday was Saturday and his pictures are in the machine, or data is stuck in the broken machine and it must come out for work.
For historical perspective, data collated by AppleInsider going back to nearly 2000 suggests that Apple's move in the Mac ecosystem to more sealed devices like the 2012 Retina MacBook Pro and later have cut failure percentages in half. More on that in the coming months as we continue to evaluate the data, though.The battery, again
And, of course, the CBC video brings up the whole iPhone battery saga again, without discussing that a battery is a chemical process that depletes and loses efficiency over time. Batteries aren't eternal, and are a consumable —which Apple has always said, if perhaps not as vociferously as it should have.
We've talked about how this happens, why this happens, and Apple's response at some length before. So we won't be doing it here again.
Yes, Apple could have been more forthcoming with the iOS update that implemented the routines to prevent a device crash when voltage dropped below the critical threshold under load. However, AppleInsider still maintains that a device that doesn't crash but runs slower is still better than one you can't rely on in a pinch.
And, importantly, these devices with a properly functioning battery still move bits from register to register and perform operations just as quick as they did the day they were made.
Of course, we'd like the $29 battery replacement process to be carried forward in perpetuity, but it looks like it won't be.
Speaking of red herrings, why the CBC said that a video of a French tax protest with nationalist overtones was a protest about repairability isn't clear.The problem with the ""undercover"" work
The device that the publication used had two problems —one, a series of tripped moisture sensors, and two, a bent pin on a connector. The sole Genius that CBC talked to followed the established procedure as set forth by Apple to examine the moisture sensors first. 
Procedures exist in all industries for a reason. The technician didn't exhibit so-called ""malicious compliance"" nor try to extort extra money out of the ""customer,"" but did his job the way he was trained to do, followed the procedure the way he was supposed to, and performed at the level of experience he was expected to have.
If every Apple store had Rossmann, or somebody with similar skill and experience, do all of the device examinations then the bent pin would have been found. But, there's still larger issues of time, and those 2700 devices per year that come in to each shop that need detailed troubleshooting.
Examinations like Rossmann performs take time. They can take a lot of time. A detailed examination and repair is more often than not a multiple man-hour process from start to finish. Which is better for the average consumer, one hour in and out of the store like can happen now, or a lengthy diagnosis, and repair?.
Any service center can reject any repair, for any reason —maybe you've heard us say this before. A botched repair, or damage induced by users tampering with equipment is specifically cited as a denial reason by Apple. This is done mostly for accountability reasons because the technician has no good way to tell what else has been damaged by the unusual failure mode.Non-Apple Retail repair shops serve an important purpose
There are good, bad, Apple-authorized, and independent repair shops, and all the permutations of those four you can dream up. The key for the user is finding a shop that gives the user the best balance between affordability, repair turn-around, and quality.
The quality independent shops, like Rossmann's, will take jobs that Apple doesn't want to do, or won't do affordably —like the ""undercover"" CBC MacBook Pro. This is a good thing.
Apple's repair rules at retail, established by Apple corporate for uniformity, are there for a reason —including denials, and board-level repairs rather than component-level ones. Related to all this, regarding ""right to repair"" —Apple not making repairs easy by supplying parts or manuals to any given user isn't the same as blocking those repairs, which it is still not doing. And like we said, iFixit demonstrated that just last week.
Apple has a vested interest in guaranteeing quality parts are available for repair. It also has a vested interest in preventing low-quality parts from entering the third-party supply chain —if perhaps it enforces those rules far too vigorously for our taste.
Customers need Apple Stores to have Genius Bars. They also need venues like Rossman's shop, and iFixit. The two broad categories are not mutually incompatible, and do not focus on the same avenues for repair —nor should they.
And, it's probably an important point to remember that Apple's design and service choices make the devices fail less often, and the repair experience smoother for those that have dead iPhones or Macs, if perhaps more expensive. And, as a general rule, those customers don't have the same level of technical acumen that AppleInsider readers have, aren't looking to do the repairs themselves, and are fine with a device replacement. 
And, these consumers outnumber ""us"" 20 to one or more."
Apple Insider,"Third betas of iOS 12.1, tvOS 12.1, and watchOS 5.1 available for developer testing [u]",10/09/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/09/third-betas-of-ios-121-tvos-121-and-watchos-51-available-for-developer-testing,"Apple has provided participants of its developer beta testing program new builds, with the third betas of iOS 12.1, tvOS 12.1, and watchOS 5.1 arriving one day after the latest macOS Mojave beta. 
Developers who have signed up for the testing program can use the latest builds after performing an over-the-air update on their enrolled devices, or can follow the instructions from the Apple Developer Center. Public beta versions typically arrive a few days after the developer betas, and can be acquired from the Apple Beta Software Program website. 
The third iOS 12.1 developer beta has build number 16B5077c, replacing the second build's 16B5068i.
So far, the iOS 12.1 beta seems to be a minor update, with the main change being the inclusion of support for Group FaceTime. A few minor changes have also been found in the code, such as horizontal Face ID support, which will likely be useful for new iPad models rumored to land later this fall. 
Apple has also teased the addition of 70 new emoji that will be arriving in iOS 12.1, which it has included in the betas. 
Details about the tvOS 12.1 beta contents are unknown, but version 12.1 is likely to consist of bug fixes and performance improvements, rather than new features. 
The third beta of tvOS 12.1's build is number 16J5593c. The second beta was build number 16J5584c. 
Apple's third watchOS 5.1 beta bears build number 16R5577c, up from the first developer beta build 16R5568d. 
Much like iOS 12.1 and macOS 10.14.1, there is relatively little known about what's included in each beta release. For watchOS 5.1, it gains the ability to answer Group FaceTime calls on the Apple Watch, with it able to handle the call via audio until the user can access an iOS device to continue in video. AppleInsider, and Apple itself, strongly advise againstinstalling beta releases on mission-critical hardware, due to the possibility of data loss and other issues. Those interested in testing the betas out should use non-essential devices, and to keep backups of any important data before installing or performing updates.Find any changes in the new betas? Reach out to us on Twitter at @AppleInsider or @Andrew_OSU, or send Andrew an email at andrew@AppleInsider.com.Update: Public beta versions of iOS 12.1 and tvOS 12.1 were also made available on Tuesday."

In June we learned that additional cast members will include Lizzy Caplan, Ron Cephas Jones, Elizabeth Perkins, Mekhi Phifer, Michael Beach, Tracie Thoms, and Haneefah Wood, but most notably Aaron Paul, playing fictional convicted murderer Warren Cave, whose innocence has been questioned for some 20 years. 
Spencer will play reporter Poppy Parnell, looking into the case for her podcast, while Caplan will play twin sisters, Josie and Lanie. Jones will be Poppy's father, Leander ""Shreve"" Scoville, while Perkins will play Cave's mother Melanie. Phifer is cast as former detective Markus Knox, and Beach will be Poppy's husband Ingram Rhoades.
Finally Thoms will play Poppy's older sister Desiree, and Wood will be another sister, Cydie.Foundation - Apr. 2018
Apple isn't the first to take a crack at Isaac Asimov's sprawling science fiction books — Fox, Sony, and Warner Bros. have all tried and failed to get feature films off the ground, and HBO aborted an attempt at its own TV series. This latest effort is being handled by Skydance Television, with industry veterans David Goyer and Josh Friedman serving as executive producers and showrunners.
The problem so far has been the scope of Asimov's story. At the center is a ""psycho-historian"" who foresees the collapse of the Galactic Empire, and sets about preventing the death of human knowledge.Central Park - March 2018
Coming from 20th Century Fox Television and Loren Bouchard, the creator of ""Bob's Burgers,"" ""Central Park"" will be Apple's first animated series, a musical tale about a family of caretakers that end up saving its namesake. The show was written by Bouchard, Josh Gad, and Nora Smith, and will star people like Leslie Odom, Jr., Stanely Tucci, and Kristen Bell.Little America - Feb. 2018
This show is being written by Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon, previously responsible for ""The Big Sick,"" and revolves around immigrant stories plucked from real-life accounts in Epic Magazine. Each episode will run just 30 minutes in an anthology format.Epic editors Joshuah Bearman and Joshua Davis will serve as executive producers. The show will be developed by studio Uni TV.Untitled M. Night Shyamalan thriller - Feb. 2018
Little is known about the show beyond it having ten 30-minute episodes, the first being directed by Shyamalan, the rest only being produced by him. His output is infamously mixed, including hits like ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" but also bombs like ""Avatar: The Last Airbender."" The show will be Shyamalan's second TV production, after executive producing Fox's ""Wayward Pines.""
Leading writing will be Tony Basgallop, who has worked on projects like ""24: Legacy,"" ""Inside Men,"" and ""EastEnders."" Jason Blumenthal, Todd Black, and Steve Tisch of production company Escape Artists are also executive producers, and Taylor Latham will be co-executive producing. Swagger - Feb. 2018
The drama will serve as a biography of NBA player Kevin Durant, but also dive into the Amateur Athletic Union and the players, families, and coaches involved with the program.
Durant himself will be involved as a producer, working in conjunction with Imagine Television, run by Brian Grazer and Ron Howard. Reggie Rock Bythewood will write and direct.Carpool Karaoke - Feb. 2018
Apple has opted to renew ""Carpool Karaoke"" for a second season according to CBS, which hosts ""The Late Late Show with James Corden"" — from which ""Carpool Karaoke"" was spun off. 
Most planned guests are unknown. Last season featured people like Will Smith, Metallica, and ""Game of Thrones"" stars Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams. An episode with Linkin Park and Ken Jeong was one of the last things recorded by Linkin Park singer Chester Bennington before his suicide.
A new episode is set to debut June 15, promoting the movie ""Tag"" by featuring stars Ed Helms, Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm. Whereas the first season was limited to Apple Music subscribers, this new episode will be available through the company's TV app.Untitled Damien Chazelle project - Jan 2018
Chazelle is working with fellow ""La La Land"" peers Jordan Horowitz and Fred Berger, who will serve as producers, on a show with no other known details.Untitled sketch comedy show - Jan. 2018
This one will star comedienne Kristen Wiig, and be based on a shorty story collection by Curtis Sittenfelds called ""You Think It, I'll Say It."" The effort is one of three Apple shows linked to Reese Witherspoon's Hello Sunshine studio, the others being the morning show drama and ""Are You Sleeping.""See - Jan. 2018
Described as an ""epic, world-building drama"" set in the future, ""See"" is written by Steven Knight (""Peaky Blinders"") and directed by Francis Lawrence (""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire and Mockingjay Parts 1 & 2""). 
""Game of Thrones"" alum Jason Momoa is set to star in the sci-fi drama that is expected to run eight episodes. Home - Jan. 2018
A docuseries rather than fiction, ""Home"" will focus on unusual homes and the people behind them. Currently 10 episodes are queued up.
The show is being produced by Altimeter Films, Time Inc. Productions, and Media Weaver Entertainment, with director Matt Tyrnauer at the helm. Tyrnauer is perhaps best known for a 2008 film about fashion designer Valentino Garavani.Untitled Ronald D. Moore space drama - Dec. 2017
Another mystery project, it is at least known to be set in an alternate timeline in which the 1960s' space race never ended. Moore is a high-profile figure in the science fiction world, with credits such as the ""Battlestar Galactica"" reboot and ""Star Trek: The Next Generation.""
It will boast ""Fargo"" producers Matt Wolpert and Ben Nedivi, and come from Sony Pictures Television and Tall Ship Productions.Untitled morning show drama - Nov. 2017
Based on the Brian Stelter novel ""Top of the Morning: Inside the Cutthroat World of Morning TV,"" Apple has already ordered two seasons. This may be because of its big talent get: Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, who will both star and executive produce. The series is being written and executive produced by ""House of Cards"" supervising producer and political consultant Jay Carson.Amazing Stories - Oct. 2017
Based on a two-season Steven Spielberg anthology series from the 1980s, Apple has reportedly ordered 10 episodes with a budget of over $5 million each. The new show may be similar in tone to ""The Twilight Zone"" or ""Black Mirror,"" with Spielberg back on as an executive producer.
It hasn't had the smoothest run so far. Original showrunner Bryan Fuller left in February, to be replaced by ""Once Upon a Time"" creators Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis. Fuller allegedly wanted the show to be closer in tone to ""Black Mirror,"" but Apple objected, presumably because of its demands for a sanitized programming lineup.Beyond TV
Apple's first distributed feature film could from Cartoon Saloon, known for animated movies like ""The Secret of Kells"" and more recently ""The Breadwinner."" While Apple is said to be nearing a distribution deal for the U.S. and some other countries, as of June 2018 the movie has yet to be made and is over a year away."
Apple Insider,"Google unveils Pixel 3 phone, Pixel Slate tablet & Google Home Hub",10/09/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/09/google-unveils-pixel-3-phone-pixel-slate-tablet-google-home-hub,"Firing its latest salvos at Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft, Google on Tuesday announced several new devices, led by its Pixel 3 and 3 XL Android smartphones.
The phones have 5.5- and 6.3-inch edge-to-edge displays, with Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processors, 4 gigabytes of RAM, Bluetooth 5.0, and front-facing stereo speakers. The devices continue to use single-lens, 12.2-megapixel rear-facing cameras, but there are two lenses on the front, the second offering an ultra-wide field of view.
Google has also upgraded the Pixel line with wireless charging up to 10 watts, and is selling an optional Pixel Stand to match. The latter triggers a custom interface during docking — for instance making it act like a Smart Display/Google Home, and gradually adjusting lighting for wake-up alarms.
The phones run Android 9 Pie, but have a unique feature enabling Google Assistant to screen telemarketing calls with options to block or reply.
The Pixel 3 and 3 XL, shipping Oct. 18, start at $799 and $899 for 64-gigabyte models. Upgrading to 128 gigabytes costs an extra $100. Verizon is the only third-party carrier offering the phone directly (and running a buy one, get one deal already), but Google is selling the phone unlocked, including through its Project Fi wireless service.
Another product revealed today was the Home Hub, Google's first self-made product based on its Smart Display platform. The product is similar to the JBL Link View or Lenovo Smart Display, but deliberately omits a camera, avoiding some privacy concerns. 
One new feature is Home View, a swipe-down dashboard for quicker control of smarthome accessories. Another is Live Albums, an option for Google Photos wallpaper which can automatically add images with specific people in them. Machine learning is used to discard blurry photos or images of objects like receipts.
The Home Hub has a 7-inch LCD and Bluetooth 5.0, and is being sold in aqua, pink, white, and charcoal colors. It ships Oct. 22 for $149.
Finally the company previewed the Pixel Slate, a Chrome OS tablet with an optional stylus and keyboard cover, similar to Microsoft's Surface line. It has stereo speakers, 8-megapixel cameras, and a 12.3-inch display. While the base $599 configuration uses an Intel Celeron processor, the $1,599 top-end system has a Core i7 chip, 16 gigabytes of RAM, and 256 gigabytes of storage."
Apple Insider,Review: Ultimate Ears MegaBoom 3 pumps out the tunes with ample bass,10/09/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/09/review-ue-megaboom-3-pumps-out-the-tunes-with-ample-bass,"Ultimate Ears MegaBoom 3 is the latest incarnation of arguably one of the best and most popular portable Bluetooth speakers. The newly updated models finally have a design refresh, albeit a small one, as well as better sounding audio quality.Design and controls
In their typical fashion, the Ultimate Ears MegaBoom is a tall cylinder, reaching nearly nine inches in height, just about an inch and a half more than the standard Ultimate Ears Boom.
On the front, Ultimate Ears has ditched the vertical rubber stripe behind the + and - signs, which looks better and gives more uniform 360-degree audio.
There is also a new fabric wrapped around the outside, which feels great. It is such a wonderful, grippy texture, and the new version has a two-tone look that we love (especially the purple/blue).
MegaBoom 3 is water resistance, earning an IP67 rating. Specifically, the speaker can survive submersion in up to a meter of water for 30 minutes without being damaged. But, for that to happen, something will have to have gone terribly wrong, as the speaker also floats. 
On top is a new ""Magic Button"", alongside power and Bluetooth buttons. The Magic Button is used to play/pause/skip tracks. That Magic Button has a few tricks though, for instance when you press and hold it, the speaker will turn on, automatically connect to your device, then start playing one of your four Apple Music presets. Hold again, it cycles to the next playlist.
For volume adjustments, that is relegated to the large + and - icons along the front.
Around the back is a ""hang loop"" used to connect the speaker to a tree branch, the side of a backpack, or other structure while listening. Some sort of carabiner or rope would clearly be needed to do this, however.Connectivity
Megaboom 3 connects to your devices over Bluetooth, rather than Wi-Fi, as is expected for a rugged portable speaker. Each speaker is able to connect to up to two sources at the same time, though pair with eight overall.
Using the app, multiple speakers can be connected together to amplify the sound. Over 150 can be connected, but we clearly didn't test out the limit.
Ultimate Ears rates the wireless range of the Megaboom at 150 feet. In our unscientific tests, we didn't get quite that amount, though it was certainly better outside with no obstacles in the way.
To charge the Megaboom 3, there is a micro USB port, which was relocated from the bottom to the back — a much better location. However, it is still micro USB.
We can't say this too many times — manufacturers need to start adding USB-C to devices rather than micro USB. Ultimate Ears says the choice was made because the market is not ready when it comes to USB-C adoption. But, how will the market ever adopt it if manufacturers refuse to add support? 
It is hard to take Ultimate Ears seriously when they say the market is not ready when so many major new products are supporting it, and it is unquestionably the future of wired connectivity in the near future. Consider the Nintendo Switch, the latest cameras such as those from Nikon and GoPro, new headphones, and of course all of Apple's portable computers.
In our opinion, it is frustrating to see manufacturers release a new product at the tail end of 2018 and still opt to include micro USB instead of USB-C, especially as anyone who picks one up will likely want to keep it around for a few years.
As an alternative, however, Ultimate Ears did add support for their wireless Power Up charger that came out with their MegaBlast line of speakers.Sound
We were very happy with the sound output on the Ultimate Ears MegaBoom 3, though it should be no surprise. For the price, the Megaboom 3 has some of the best sound available. There are certainly ones better, but few if any balance the sound with the price tag quite so well.
It is no surprise why these speakers are so popular. Other than the design, the sound is crisp and clear with enough bass to get the party started. Being able to connect multiple for even more amplification is sure to sell anyone.
We've also been consistent fans of the 360-degree speaker designs which really work well when listening in a room. Omnidirectional speakers seem to be where everyone is headed, and with the removal of the rubber bar down the front, the MegaBoom 3 just increased their lead here.
For those who want more control, Ultimate Ears has four different sound presets as well as an equalizer to tune it to your tastes. When indoors with our neighbors, we were able to turn down the bass. When we took it with us outside to play volleyball, we bumped it up.
Ultimate Ears says the MegaBoom 3 has a wider frequency range, as well as much more powerful bass when compared to the smaller Boom.
In total, the MegaBoom 3 can put out about 90 decibels of sound which is just below the 100DB put out by the well-reviewed Marshall Kilburn II. It is also just shy of Ultimate Ears other large speaker, the Wi-Fi connect MegaBlast, which boasts a maximum output of 93DB.Ultimate Ears = ultimate sound
The new Ultimate Ears Megaboom is an amply capable speaker that is well suited for taking on the road, in small to large spaces. The durable exterior looks sharp, feels great, and is easy to clean should the need ever arise.
Our biggest qualm is the choice to continue to use micro USB over USB-C, but that shouldn't sway potential buyers too much.Rating 4.5 out of 5Where to buy
The Ultimate Ears MegaBoom 3 Portable Bluetooth Wireless Speaker retails for $199.99 and is available in three colors: Lagoon Blue, Night Black and Sunset Red (the latter of which is available on Oct. 31 at Amazon)."
Apple Insider,Apple's Tim Cook visits Shanghai amid alleged Chinese iCloud spy chip debacle,10/09/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/09/apples-tim-cook-visits-shanghai-amid-alleged-chinese-icloud-spy-chip-debacle,"Apple's CEO is making a surprise tour of Shanghai, possibly in response to the controversy over a report claiming Chinese spy chips were inserted into Apple servers.
The executive has already visited a local Apple store, and a yoga studio where people were using Apple Watches to track workouts, according to his Weibo account. He also used his Watch to take a ferry, and praised a pair of photographers — ""Bigshot"" and ""ChenMan"" — for their work with the iPhone XS Max. 
It's unknown if Cook has any greater agenda in the city, but his trips outside the U.S. frequently involve meetings with political and corporate leaders, often revealed after the fact. 
The CEO may be in China partly to address a recent Bloomberg report which claimed that the Chinese government planted tiny chips onto motherboards produced by Super Micro, which then went out to 30 companies including Apple and Amazon. In Apple's case, the boards are said to have made their way into iCloud data centers, where they opened back doors and funneled data.
Apple has repeatedly denied the presence of any chips, including in a letter to the U.S. Congress. Various groups have cast doubt on the story, including the Department of Homeland Security and the U.K.'s GCHQ.
Cook could be probing his company's supply chain, talking to Communist Party officials, or possibly taking steps to ensure that even if chips weren't implanted earlier, it can't happen in the future. Another possible mission for Cook may be dealing with the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China, which has threatened to raise the prices of Apple products."
Apple Insider,Apple's work on electromagnets could help protect future iPads and iPhones when dropped,10/09/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/09/apples-work-on-electromagnets-could-help-protect-future-ipads-and-iphones-when-dropped,"Apple is considering ways it could use electromagnets to make changes to the way accessories or devices can magnetically connect to each other, including correcting alignment issues for covers and potentially helping a case provide even more protection for a dropped iPhone or iPad. 
Awarded by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Tuesday, the patent for a ""Dynamically stabilized magnetic array"" describes how electromagnets could be used alongside permanent magnets to improve how magnetic connections function. For the most part, this relates to accessories like the Smart Cover cover for theiPad, which attaches to the side of the tablet using magnets, but it could also apply to other devices. 
Most of the time, the magnets used for these purposes are permanent, with a fixed size, strength, and shape that barely changes over time, and are a relatively known quantity. As electromagnets are temporary, they could be used to increase the strength of a magnetic connection for a short period of time, such as if an iPad detects the cover may be accidentally separated if it is bumped or jostled. 
While the initial idea is to supplement the existing permanent magnets in a cover, Apple suggests the electromagnets don't need to be on all of the time, instead only turning on when needed. It is also suggested the electromagnets could periodically turn on, in order to force the case to maintain or correct its alignment, such as if a cover isn't correctly lined up on the side of an iPad. 
In order to power the electromagnets, Apple suggests the inclusion of a magnetic field sensor in the magnetic array, which will turn on the other electromagnets once it detects a magnet has been placed alongside it. For covers, this would give the effect of the electromagnets turning on once it is close to being in place, with the powered magnets providing the final snap-into-place and alignment. 
The same concept could allow for magnetic grips of varying sizes to be added to the edge of a device, activated once a known peripheral or accessory is in use or nearby. When detected, the magnets could turn on in specific places to allow the Apple Pencil to be holstered, for example. With the magnets deactivated when the stylus is removed. 
In one notable example, a device is held in place within a case with magnets, keeping the device within the middle section. There is a small boundary between the sides of the device and of the case, caused through the magnets constantly pulling in all directions at once. 
At the time a fall is detected, some of the electromagnets in the device are deactivated, dragging the device away from the edge that is likely to impact the floor and closer to the opposite side. This creates a larger buffer in the case on the edge or corner that will be hit, potentially preventing damage to the tablet. 
Electromagnet arrays could also be used to provide tactile feedback to the user, such as with the placement of a cover sheet ""keyboard"" on top of a touch display. The array behind the display could repulse the ""key"" sections of the covering keyboard, giving a sense of resistance to the user when the key is typed. 
While the idea of using magnets and electromagnets in these ways may be appealing, Apple does register a considerable amount of patent applications every week, and not all concepts make their way into commercial products. Despite the appearance of a patent, there is no guarantee that Apple will follow through with this idea in the future. 
The last section of the patent may have some potential usage alongside other patents and applications that Apple has examined relating to alternative keyboards. Previously it has applied for a patent for a ""keyless keyboard"" with haptic feedback, and was granted a patent for using a second screen in place of a keyboard. 
Apple has also looked into ways to make the Smart Cover smarter, such as displaying essential information when only part of a cover is lifted off the device, and covers with illuminated sections and extra displays."

The peripheral features enhanced circuitry for better analog to digital conversion, a digital encoder knob, and stereo output for direct headphone or speaker connections. A ""Blend"" button turns on low-latency monitoring, and an ""Overdrive"" mode is intended to make virtual amps and pedals feel more realistic.
The Jam+ supports 24-bit, 96-kilohertz recording, and comes bundled with Lightning, USB-A, and USB-C cables. It also comes with Positive Grid's BIAS JAM FX software for Mac and Windows, which includes 3 amps, 6 effects, and an assortment of ""essential"" pedals.
The original Jam dates back to 2010, and is still on sale.
The Jam+ is launching today at a cost of $159. It's available from Apogee and a number of third-party retailers, including Apple retail stores."
Apple Insider,Hands on: AmpliFi Instant Home Wi-Fi Mesh System,10/09/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/09/hands-on-amplifi-instant-home-wi-fi-mesh-system,"The AmpliFi Instant Home Wi-Fi Mesh System is designed to deliver hassle-free Wi-Fi that can be set up functioning in two minutes. But is it a worthy replacement for Apple's AirPort systems?
AmpliFi Instant, released on Tuesday, is a two-unit set consisting of a main router and a mesh access point. Both devices are identical in size and share a lot in looks. 
The units are short, rectangular and have a matte white finish with rounded edges and corners. Around the bottom perimeter is a soft white light ring that is adjustable in the AmpliFi app for on, off, or off at hours during the night, a nice option if you position it in a highly visible area and don't want the light keeping you up.
Where the two units differ is the router has a small monochrome display, a WAN gigabit port and one LAN gigabit port. The mesh point has no display and has one gigabit port that can be used either to give signal to a wired device or connect to an Ethernet line back to the router for backhaul between the two units.Coverage, Speed
We tried the setup in a house that has known signal issues. The homeowner has tried to solve their problems by adding a second access point upstairs, but there are still dead spots. Those dead spots were eliminated with AmpliFi Instant, which delivered strong signal throughout the building.
A series of speed tests showed that Wi-Fi was fast, in the 420Mbps range down, reliably on AT&T fiber. However, upload speeds on AT&T fiber averaged at about 358Mbps. When using the prior access points, that speed was closer to a symmetric 426Mbps. 
In testing in a home with Google Fiber, similar asymmetric results appeared. It was possible to get 318Mbps down, but upload was limited to about 120Mbps. When using routers made by other manufacturers, we regularly attained symmetric 500mbps over Wi-Fi, which is about as good as can be expected. What's good
One of the changes to this AmpliFi series, which uses the same firmware as an earlier product, is that it has some features for advanced users. 
First, it's possible to set the range issued for DHCP (LAN addresses). Another unique feature is the capability of tagging the WAN port with a VLAN, which is helpful if your ISP requires it to use VLAN tagging instead of their router-network-box. 
Unfortunately, in order to make the connection perform as fast as it should with ISPs that require VLAN tagging, you have to set Quality of Service (QoS) for the WAN port to normal priority, something AmpliFi has not done. This is one of those situations where something was almost perfect, and is more disappointing than if it hadn't tried instead of coming close and failing to go all the way. 
Also good is the ability to assign devices to static reserved IP addresses. It doesn't allow you to configure what DNS server to use on the LAN, only the WAN side, so if you were running a DNS server as an Adblock, that wouldn't work here. But otherwise, all the complex options are present. 
On top of this, all devices appear in a tab called ""Family,"" which is used for pausing internet connectivity. Users can pause devices individually, effective immediately, or create profiles for devices with hourly schedules set by day of week. Extending existing Wi-Fi
Besides the two-unit kit, it's possible to buy just the router and use it as a mesh point to extend an existing network. This function works brilliantly. 
In the old days, you'd have to use WDS sharing, which was absurd. AmpliFi's method of network extension works as well or better than Apple's means. We paired the AmpliFi Instant Router acting as a mesh node with a Synology RT2600AC as the main router, and coverage was excellent.What's less than good
There are two radios,  2.4 and 5Ghz, as opposed to having three radios, and using one as dedicated for backhaul. The backhaul between units is either wired Ethernet or wireless. The default is to use the 5Ghz band for backhaul to the main unit, which means client devices associated with the mesh point will get slower 2.4Ghz bandwidth data.
Ideally, you'd have two 5Ghz radios and a 2.4Ghz, so that one 5Ghz could be used for backhaul communication to the main router and still deliver 5Ghz to clients. That would also be more expensive. 
Using the single router unit to test speeds, eliminating any weak links in wireless backhaul, download was less than expected, and upload was much less than expected. 
Remote access still seems to be limited to Google or Facebook accounts, something we noted as less than desirable in our previous experiences with AmpliFi products. Conclusion
AmpliFi has accomplished quite a lot here. 
It has made a fast-to-setup Wi-Fi mesh network that is pretty robust and has a number of complex options built-in, but nicely hidden so as not to scare people who just want to get Wi-Fi working fast. It has some decent parental blocking, but not filtering, and makes it easy to set up a mesh network or extend an existing network with an additional mesh node. 
Speeds weren't as fast as our main use router, but it really should fill most people's needs as an easy to set up and easy to manage system. 
One of the advantages of the Instant system is pricing. By using a monochrome screen, by not building a four port switch and choosing to use either 2.4 or 5Ghz for wireless backhaul, AmpliFi keeps the cost down. 
The AmpliFi Instant Router will be available starting at $99.99 while the AmpliFi Instant 2-pack (AmpliFi Instant Router + Instant MeshPoint) will be available for $179.99."

Apple Insider,"Devialet reveals $999 Phantom Reactor, hints at possible AirPlay 2 support",10/09/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/09/devialet-reveals-999-phantom-reactor-hints-at-possible-airplay-2-support,"Devialet on Tuesday revealed the Phantom Reactor, a smaller version of its signature Phantom speaker intended to be affordable beyond the wealthy.
Depending on the version, the Phantom Reactor can deliver either 600 or 900 watts of peak power, producing up to 98 decibels at full volume. The speaker nevertheless has a frequency range between 18 hertz and 21 kilohertz, and Devialet claims distortion-free sound at every volume setting.
In addition to analog, optical, and Ethernet inputs, the speaker offers Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, the latter compatible with AirPlay, UPnP, and Spotify Connect. A 2019 update will add Chromecast Audio as well as pairing multiple speakers.
The product doesn't yet support AirPlay 2, but CEO Franck Lebouchard hinted at the prospect in an interview with TechCrunch, explaining why there's no onboard voice assistant.
""We are completely focused on sound quality. We want to be platform agnostic with Apple, Amazon or Google,"" he said. ""Our idea is that we want to make our speakers compatible with all the protocols from those companies — but our business is sound quality.""
The standard Phantom is already compatible with AirPlay 2, and in fact was one of the earlier adopters of the standard.
The headline feature of AirPlay 2 is multi-room audio, but it also offers a substantially bigger streaming buffer versus the original AirPlay protocol, helping to reduce interruptions and provide continued streaming even as an iPhone or iPad runs other tasks. AirPlay speakers will appear in the Mac and iOS Home apps, and can be controlled there or via Siri, albeit only to play, pause, or shift rooms.
Preorders for the Reactor start on Wednesday ahead of an Oct. 24 ship date. The 600-watt model will cost $999, while the 900-watt model will come in at $1,299."
Apple Insider,Security researcher cited in Bloomberg's China spy chip investigation casts doubt on story's veracity [u],10/08/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/08/security-researcher-cited-in-bloombergs-china-spy-chip-investigation-casts-doubt-on-storys-veracity,"Security researcher Joe Fitzpatrick, one of the few sources named in Bloomberg Businessweek's bombshell China hack investigation, in a podcast this week said he felt uneasy after reading the article in part because its claims almost perfectly echoed theories on hardware implants he shared with journalist Jordan Robertson. 
Fitzpatrick detailed his dealings with Bloomberg to Patrick Gray of Risky Business in a podcast published on Monday. 
The security specialist first spoke with Robertson last year, just prior to giving a presentation on hardware implants at the DEF CON hacking convention. The impetus behind Robertson's questioning was not made clear to Fitzpatrick until last month.  
In his conversations with the journalist, Fitzpatrick detailed how hardware implants work, specifically noting successful proof-of-concept devices he demonstrated at Black Hat in 2016. While he is a security researcher, Fitzpatrick is not in the business of selling such devices to customers —  let alone nation states —  and is for the most part working off theories derived from years of teaching others how to secure their own hardware. 
When asked what, exactly, he found strange about Bloomberg's claims, Fitzpatrick said, ""It was surprising to me that in a scenario where I would describe these things and then he would go and confirm these and 100% of what I described was confirmed by sources.""
Further, the story as told ""doesn't really make sense."" As Fitzpatrick notes, there are easier, more cost-effective methods of attaining backdoor access into a target computer network. Bloomberg in its article claimed Chinese operatives managed to sneak a microchip smaller than a grain of rice onto motherboards produced by hardware supplier Supermicro. Supposedly designed by the Chinese military, the chip acted as a ""stealth doorway onto any network"" and offered ""long-term stealth access"" to attached computer systems. 
Nearly 30 companies were reportedly impacted by the breach, though only Amazon and Apple were mentioned by named in the story. Both companies have released strongly worded denials, with Apple characterizing the report as ""wrong and misinformed."" 
""Spreading hardware fear, uncertainty and doubt is entirely in my financial gain, but it doesn't make sense because there are so many easier ways to do this,"" Fitzpatrick said, referring to the purported hardware implant. ""There are so many easier hardware ways, there are software, there are firmware approaches. There approach you are describing is not scalable. It's not logical. It's not how I would do it. Or how anyone I know would do it.""
Fitzpatrick said as much to Robertson in an email exchange, pointing out the described backdoor attack can be just as easily accomplished by remotely modifying the firmware of ""most BMCs"" (baseboard management controllers) as many run outdated software. He went on to ask whether the additional hardware sources supposedly discovered on the boards were merely counterfeit prevention, bypassing implants or some other functional component added by a legitimate third-party.  
In one email exchange, he cautioned that inexperienced observers might mistake combination hardware — flash storage and a micro controller, for example —  as a hardware implant. The Bloomberg investigation claims the spy chips were incorporated into another, inconspicuous component that took on the appearance of signal conditioning couplers. 
Robertson in an emailed reply confirmed that the idea ""sounded crazy,"" but said ""lots of sources"" corroborated the information. Fitzpatrick was not convinced.  
""And you know I'm still skeptical. I followed up being like, 'Yeah, okay if they wanted to backdoor every single Supermicro motherboard, I guess this is the approach that makes sense,"" he told Gray. ""But I still in my mind I couldn't rationalize that this is the approach any one would choose to take.""
Robertson was unable to produce photographic evidence of the chips in question, saying they were described to him by protected sources. Indeed, Robertson in September asked Fitzpatrick what a ""signal amplifier or coupler"" looks like, suggesting the publication narrowed the attack package down to that particular component. Fitzpatrick sent Robertson a link to a very small signal coupler sold by Mouser Electronics. 
""Turns out that's the exact coupler in all the images in the story,"" Fitzpatrick said. 
While the illustration used in the Bloomberg story is just that, Fitzpatrick argues similar components would be an unlikely choice for the attack vector described. Larger, albeit less conspicuous hardware is available, namely chips that mimic the SOIC-8 package. Further, pint-size signal couplers are not standard fare for server motherboards that do not include Wi-Fi or LTE. 
""But it's just not the easiest package to choose to use with something like this, it's not a package you'd expect to find in a motherboard,"" he said. ""It's something where if it's on your motherboard you'd be like, 'What the heck is that doing there for?'""
Whether the Supermicro boards in question integrated wireless radio technologies is unclear. Bloomberg stands by its original reporting. The year-long investigation incorporates information from 17 sources, some of whom work or worked for the allegedly impacted companies or the U.S. government. 
""As is typical journalistic practice, we reached out to many people who are subject matter experts to help us understand and describe technical aspects of the attack. The specific ways the implant worked were described, confirmed, and elaborated on by our primary sources who have direct knowledge of the compromised Supermicro hardware. Joe FitzPatrick was not one of these 17 individual primary sources that included company insiders and government officials, and his direct quote in the story describes a hypothetical example of how a hardware attack might play out, as the story makes clear,"" a Bloomberg News spokesperson said in a statement to AppleInsider. ""Our reporters and editors thoroughly vet every story before publication, and this was no exception.""
Apple executives and high-ranking security engineers said an internal investigation into Bloomberg's claims revealed no evidence of the hardware tampering in question, nor did the company identify unrelated incidents from which the allegations could have conceivably arisen. 
Apple said much the same in a letter to Congress issued over the weekend. 
For his part, Fitzpatrick said Bloomberg's account of what transpired, if anything, is suspect.
""I have the expertise to look at he technical details and I have the knowledge to look at the technical details and see that they're jumbled. They're not outright wrong, but they are theoretical,"" he said. ""I don't have the knowledge to know the other conversations —  the other 17 sources and what they said, but I can infer based on the technical side of things that the non-technical side of things may be jumbled the same way.""Updated with response from Bloomberg spokesperson."
Apple Insider,"Rumor: Next-gen iPad Pro to feature 'Magnetic Connector,' USB-C, support new Apple Pencil",10/08/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/08/rumor-next-gen-ipad-pro-to-feature-magnetic-connector-support-new-apple-pencil,"Later this month, Apple is expected to update its iPad Pro lineup with new models featuring Face ID biometric authentication and near bezel-less displays. According to the latest rumors, the redesigned tablets might also be equipped with a new ""Magnetic Connector"" and support for an updated Apple Pencil.
Echoing long-standing rumors regarding the next generation of iPad Pro, 9to5Mac, citing sources familiar with the matter, reports the devices will indeed ditch the home button in favor of Face ID. Instead of carrying over the ""notch"" aesthetic introduced with iPhone X, the larger tablets will incorporate Apple's TrueDepth camera system in its bezel, a design facet that has previously been reported on multiple occasions.  
The new devices will supposedly support 4K HDR output to external monitors and TVs over an integrated USB-C port. A new panel in the Settings app will enable control over resolution, brightness and HDR options, the report says. Previous rumors have hinted Apple intends to replace Lightning with USB-C as it looks to support higher bandwidth applications.
Another new tidbit from the report claims Apple is not only updating its Smart Connector to what the publication calls a ""Magnetic Connector,"" but will relocate the port to iPad's rear. The new connector will supposedly support new accessories beyond the usual keyboard, though the report failed to detail what add-ons are expected. 
Also rumored is a next-generation Apple Pencil that pairs when in close proximity to an iPad. The solution is in the same vein as AirPods or HomePod. 
Sources identified this year's model identifiers as ""iPad8,1,"" ""iPad8,2,"" ""iPad8,5"" and ""iPad8,6"" for Wi-Fi only and ""iPad8,1,"" ""iPad8,4,"" ""iPad8,7"" and ""iPad8,8"" for cellular-enabled versions.
The report also confirms previous rumors regarding Face ID support in both portrait and landscape modes.
Apple is expected to announce a new slate of iPad Pro models at a special event later this month. Check out AppleInsider's analysis of the presumed October event for more details."
Apple Insider,Apple ceases iOS 11.4.1 signing following release of iOS 12,10/08/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/08/apple-ceases-ios-1141-signing-following-release-of-ios-12,"Apple on Monday stopped signing code for iOS 11.4.1, the last version of iOS to be issued prior to the release of iOS 12 in September.
With the change, users can only download and install iOS 12 and above from Apple's servers. Those who have already upgraded to iOS 12, or the just released iOS 12.0.1, can no longer revert back to iOS 11. 
Apple typically stops signing code for past releases about a month after a newer iOS version is issued to the public. The current iOS point release, iOS 12, was pushed out on Sept. 17, putting today's halt to downgrades roughly on par with previous moves. 
A major update that concentrates more on bolstering existing functionality than adding new features, iOS 12 delivers enhanced performance for older iPhones, digital life management tools like Screen Time, Memoji characters for devices with the TrueDepth camera system and enhanced augmented reality functionality. Other highlights include improvements to Siri, Photos, notifications and more. 
Apple regularly ceases code signing to prevent users from installing old iOS versions following the release of a new OS. The strategy keeps users safe and ensures devices are running the most up-to-date software, thus easing potential compatibility issues with new features and software. 
The company today issued a minor update in iOS 12.0.1 to address bugs introduced with the latest operating system version. Notably, the release fixes Lightning charging issues experienced by a number of iPhone owners, as well as Wi-Fi connectivity issues suffered by users of the new iPhone XS series. 
Apple last week issued a second beta version of iOS 12.1 to developers and public testers for evaluation ahead of an expected launch in the coming weeks. When it sees release, the update will deliver marquee iOS 12 feature Group FaceTime and support for more than 70 new emoji characters."
Apple Insider,Apple's iPhone network provisioning tech target of patent lawsuit,10/08/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/08/apples-iphone-network-provisioning-tech-target-of-patent-lawsuit,"Apple is again in the crosshairs of Uniloc, with the patent aggregator alleging the process by which iPhone and cellular-connected iPad and Apple Watch models infringes on owned intellectual property. 
In a lawsuit filed with the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas on Monday, Uniloc claims Apple infringes on an assigned patent detailing the configuration of a device when it initially connects to a wireless network. 
Specifically, U.S. Patent No.  6,856,616 for a ""System and method for providing service provider configurations for telephones using a central server in a data network telephony system,"" covers provisioning a ""telephone"" for use on a mobile data network using an identifying part number, or device identifier. 
Once recognized by the wireless carrier via SIM card, the device is provided the address to a proxy server through which an initial configuration process is completed. 
Filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in 2000, the '616 patent was signed over to 3Com that same year. Hewlett-Packard took control of the IP, and more than 1,500 other assets, in 2010 as part of its acquisition of 3Com. 
The '616 patent changed hands to Uniloc's main Luxembourg arm in 2017 and was duly assigned to Uniloc 2017 LLC in May of this year. 
Uniloc alleges all iPhone models from iPhone 5 through iPhone XS Max and cellular connected iPads including fourth- and fifth-generation iPad models, all iPad mini versions, iPad Pro, first- and second-generation iPad Air models and Apple Watch Series 1 through 3 infringe on multiple patent claims. 
Uniloc seeks unspecified damages, reimbursement of legal fees and other relief deemed fit by the court. 
Today's lawsuit arrives less than a week after Uniloc filed a complaint against Apple over AirDrop technology. The pair of suits breaks months of calm in what was a rapid-fire barrage of legal actions lodged last year. 
In 2017 alone, Uniloc sued over Maps, Apple ID, remote software updates, AirPlay, autodialing, battery technology, device wake-up, step tracking, AirPlay, the Home app, the Apple TV Remote app and Apple Watch GPS capabilities. Many of those actions leverage IP from 3Com's patent trove. 
Uniloc is one of the most active patent trolls in the U.S., leveraging reassigned patents or vaguely worded original IP against a number of tech firms including Activision Blizzard, Aspyr, Electronic Arts, McAfee, Microsoft, Rackspace, Sega, Sony, Symantec and others."
Apple Insider,Review: Nomad wireless Base Station is all about convenience,10/08/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/08/review-nomad-wireless-base-station-is-all-about-convenience,"The Nomad wireless Bast Station is a slim, dual wireless charger with fast USB outputs to power all your gear at once —but Apple Watch owners seeking wireless charging need not apply.
With AirPower still out of the picture, accessory makers have rolling out their own solutions to the market to capitalize on the vacuum. Nomad is just one of the latest to try their hand at a multi-purpose wireless charging station, and it is easily the most successful yet —although it does leave watch owners out in the cold.
There are two main aspects to any charger — charging prowess and aesthetics. Let's dig into both of those, starting with the specs.Raw specs
There are four outputs on the Nomad Base Station. Dual 10-watt wireless chargers, a 7.5-watt USB-A port, and an 18-watt USB-C port with Power Delivery all make an appearance.
The usual chargers may have a USB-A port, but limit it to 5W. They also may have USB-C, but lack Power Delivery. Others have multiple Qi coils, but are limited to 5W on iPhones. Nomad sidesteps all of these common pitfalls.
There are a total of three charging coils on the top — one to the left, one to the right, one in the center. When placing your device, you have the option of charging two phones perpendicular to the body or rotate a single phone horizontally and charging it laying completely on the leather.
What is interesting about the coils that are used, is their placement requirements. When any company designs a charger, they have the option of choosing how picky the coils are about phone placement. In other words, how centered the phone must be before it is able to charge.
In a lot of other chargers, the placement radius is larger, which gives users more leniency. The downside is that the farther off center the more the charging speed is reduced. To keep the speeds fast and consistent — 7W on iPhones, 10W on compatible Android handsets — Nomad tightened up the radius. It is a bit more specific in placement, but charges quickly, and reliably.Design
Nomad's Base Station has leather covering the coils themselves, giving it more of a premium feeling than others on the market. Most of the remaining body is made of molded aluminum. 
On the front, are LED status lights. Usually, we are annoyed by the brightness of these lights, but Nomad smartly included an ambient light sensor to adjust the brightness based on the conditions that surround the charger. This is a neat trick they picked up when creating their Tile-equipped portable power bank.
The bottom of the charging station has rubber feet, which prevents the whole apparatus from moving around.
All the ports are around the back, including the power input, and the two USB outputs. Nomad's included power brick is quite large and took some maneuvering to fit into our already in-demand outlets. The good news is, we were able to remove a couple chargers because of how many outputs the Base Station contains.Daily (and nightly) use
We've used Nomad's multi-charger for a while now, and are pretty happy with how it fits into our lives. We use the USB-A port for our Apple Watch charging puck, and the 18W port we save for our iPad Pro. Apple's USB-C Lightning cable, charges our 12.9-inch iPad Pro quite fast.
There are disadvantages. On our nightstand and desk, this leaves several cords coming out of the back of the charger which can look untidy —especially the Apple Watch cable which is unnecessarily long. If Nomad made the charger a tad longer and integrated an Apple Watch puck somehow, that would certainly be ideal. That could even keep that USB-A port open for anything else we may need to charge.
Even though the Qi charging radius is smaller, we had no issues placing our phones on the charger. The size of the charger is also almost exactly the same size as the iPhone XS Max, which is perfect for our new phone. We love the ability to turn the phones perpendicular to the orientation of the pad and charge two phones at once, or an iPhone plus our AirPods using the Hyper AirPods Qi charging case.A necessary gadget
Chargers are necessary, and wireless has certainly made things easier and look less cluttered. Nomad has a well-executed option for many to consider, with extremely fast power through all four outputs.
We love the premium materials, svelte design, and output options, though wires are strewn about. If Nomad included some form of integrated Apple Watch charger, the Base Station would be the perfect multi-device charger.Rating: 4 out of 5Where to buy
Nomad has the Base Station available to order now for $99.95. Not the cheapest wireless charger by any means, but with all four outputs, can easily be more affordable than picking up each of those indivudually."
Apple Insider,Google+ shutting down in wake of allegations of weak user data security,10/08/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/08/google-shutting-down-in-wake-of-allegations-of-weak-user-data-security,"Google has confirmed it will be closing down the social network Google+ in August next year as part of a data protection initiative called Project Strobe, but a report alleges the initiative itself was caused through Google wanting to avoid regulatory scrutiny from exposing the private data of hundreds of thousands of users. 
Project Strobe is described by Google Fellow and Vice President of Engineering Ben Smith as ""a root-and-branch review of third-party developer access to Google account and Android device data,"" and the company's philosophy surrounding apps' data access, launched at the start of 2018. This included the operation of privacy controls, platforms with low API engagement due to data privacy concerns, areas where developers may have been ""granted overly broad access,"" and other areas. 
The first ""Action"" under Project Strobe is starting the process of shutting down Google+. According to the blog post, while Google had put effort into building out the social network over the years, it ""has not achieved broad consumer or developer adoption, and has seen limited user interaction with apps."" 
It is claimed the consumer version of Google+ currently has very low usage and engagement, with 90 percent of user sessions said to last less than five seconds. Google will be winding down Google+ over the next ten months, with a full closure in August 2019. 
Google also admits to a bug in the Google+ APIs, that allowed apps granted access to a user's profile data full access, including to profile fields that were not marked as public. The data is said to be limited to just static, optional profile fields, including names, email addresses, occupation, gender, and age, but it doesn't include any data posted or connected to Google+, like account data, phone numbers, G Suite content, and even Google+ posts and messages. 
Google notes it found and patched the bug in March 2018, but due to only retaining API log data for two weeks, it is unable to confirm which users were impacted by the bug. Analysis over the two-week period before patching suggests up to 500,000 Google+ accounts were potentially affected, but while up to 438 applications may have used the API, there is apparently no evidence any developer was aware of the bug, abused the API, or that any profile data was misused. 
According to the report from the Wall Street Journal, the bug may have started in 2015, meaning the data could have been exposed for a period of three years. 
An internal memo from Google's legal and policy staff provided to the report advised senior executives away from disclosing the incident publicly, due to it most likely drawing ""immediate regulatory interest,"" and would be directly compared with Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal. Following an internal committee decision to not notify users on the issue, Google chief executive Sundar Pichai was apparently informed of the selected course of action. 
While noting there is no evidence of outside developers misusing the data, the memo also acknowledges it has no way of knowing for sure if the data wasn't misused. Report sources note internal lawyers advised the company wasn't legally required to disclose the incident, and the lack of knowledge of what data developers saw also meant there was no ""actionable benefit to the end users"" in notifying them of the bug. 
The revelation of exposed user data arrives shortly after Alphabet/Google, Amazon, Twitter, AT&T, Charter Communications, and Apple representatives testified to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on the matter of privacy. During the hearing, Apple vice president of software technology Guy ""Bud"" Tribble signaled Apple's support for federal privacy legislation to help ensure users know their data isn't being misused. 
The Project Strobe announcement also reveals Google intends to provide users with more fine-grained control over what account data they wish to share with each app. Rather than requesting on a single screen, apps will have to show each requested permission one at a time, with responses required for each individual permission type. 
There will also be an update to the User Data Policy for the consumer Gmail API to limit the apps that may seek permission to access consumer Gmail data, with only apps that directly enhance email functionality able to access the data. The same apps, which includes clients, backup services, and productivity services, will also have to agree to new rules on handling Gmail data, and will be subject to security assessments. 
The last action of the list is to limit app's ability to receive Call Log and SMS permissions on Android devices, as well as Google no longer making contact interaction data available via the Android Contacts API."
Apple Insider,"After 8 years, IDC admits Apple's iPad is leading the tablet market 'unabated'",10/08/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/08/after-8-years-idc-admits-apples-ipad-is-leading-the-tablet-market-unabated,"Since iPad launched in 2010, International Data Corporation has dutifully crafted various media narratives that belittled as it as a toy, dismissed it as merely a ""media consumption"" device in a world that needed Windows, and disparaged it as inconsequential in a vast sea of cheap Android tablets (some of which were literally children's toys). But they were wrong, here's why. iPad is rising in a sinking tablet industry: just ask IDC
While not alone, IDC has prominently constructed media narratives explaining why Apple's iPad can't possibly matter over the last eight years, initially because it didn't run the all-important Microsoft Windows, then because masses of ultra-cheap Android tablets were portrayed as an insurmountable ""market share"" diluting force, then because Microsoft itself was entering the tablet market with Detachables, and then because public interest in tablets appeared to be seriously dissipating in favor of more conventional computing devices. 
However, IDC has recently been forced to essentially admit that it was completely wrong about virtually everything in the tablet market. Tablets were indeed having an impact on the demand for conventional PCs. The public clearly wasn't buying into Microsoft's vision of tablets, whether the original Tablet PCs, Windows RT netbooks, or the latest batch of Surface-like Detachables. People who needed Windows were sticking to conventional notebooks. 
And the hardest fact to deny: Apple has remained the market leader in tablets in the critically important metric of dollars earned—as everyone else with a tablet strategy crumbles or stagnates in a global market that's shrinking faster every quarter.Bad news for iPad haters
Global tablet sales have shrunk YoY (year-on-year) for the last fifteen quarters, according to IDC's data. Across just the last year (shown in IDC's quarterly data below), the pace of declining global tablet unit sales has incrementally accelerated from a 5.4 percent drop last fall to 13.4 percent drop this summer. 
Only two of the top five tablet makers have turned in quarterly growth in each of the last four quarters: Apple (the largest tablet maker, which sold over 44 million iPads) and Huawei (which shipped 13.1 million tablets). 
Across those four quarters, Apple's iPad sales grew incrementally, adding just under two million new sales. Second place tablet vendor Samsung lost more than two million units over the same year, and its total annual sales were only 23.3 million to begin with. 
Note that Samsung sells over 70 percent more phones than Apple but earns only half as much. In tablets, Samsung is moving about half as many units as Apple across an impossibly wide range of different models (and platforms) that can't possibly be making any money at all, even as the general demand for tablets bleeds away. 
The world's third place tablet vendor by units is Amazon, with annual sales of 14.8 million units over the last four quarters. Amazon's sales are extremely seasonal however, with nearly all of its sales occurring during the Q4 holidays and on its Q3 Prime Day Sale, when it blew out units of a 7 inch model for under $30, as IDC noted.
The best IDC could say about Amazon's tablet business is that the company is now incorporating Alexa in the hopes of bolstering Amazon's retail sales. But we also know that Alexa is used mostly for playing music, that only a tiny 2 percent of its users have ever placed an order with it, and that 90 percent of those who have subsequently never tried to place an order again.
The fifth largest tablet vendor is Lenovo (combined with a joint venture with Fujitsu), which collectively shipped 10.2 million units over the past four quarters. IDC also counts another 48.8 million tablets from ""other"" vendors. However, this group of other tablet vendors reportedly shipped 65.9 million in the previous year, accounting for a 25.9 percent collective drop in units YoY.
Add in the top five vendors, and the entire global tablet market shrank by 9.2 percent YoY (from 170.1 million to 154.3 million units). Take out Apple's iOS tablets, and the market for Windows and Android tablets looks even worse: a 13.5 percent drop over the last four quarters, from 127.4 million to 110.2 million.Just as with smartphones, watches, and PCs, Apple is proving it can grow and profit within the shrinking, cutthroat tablet market
The fact that Apple's iPad sales are growing within a market that is shrinking significantly—and has been for the last four years—is particularly remarkable when you note that Apple's least expensive iPad is $329, or about ten times higher than the loss leader that accounted for much of Amazon's sales volumes (and a vast number of those ""other"" tablets). 
Just as with smartphones, watches, and PCs, Apple is proving it can grow and profit within the shrinking, cutthroat tablet market. In tablets, Apple is winning in units, in revenues, and in premium
All of the iPad boogeymen that IDC previously invented—""powerful"" Windows tablets, cheap Androids, and then tablet indifference (the idea that customers really want a PC or a smartphone, but certainly not an iPad)—have not unseated Apple as the top vendor of tablets raking in tens of billions in revenue.
The last hope for some real iPad rival has been Microsoft's push to get PC makers to build a tablet-like device that runs Windows, which IDC named ""Detachables,"" as distinct from notebooks or notebooks with a convertible display offering some tablet-like functions on a full sized PC notebook. 
In 2015, IDC explicitly predicted that Windows Detachables would rapidly eat into iPads on the high-end, offering users a hybrid middle product that was more powerful than an iPad, but more tablet-like than a MacBook. Three years earlier, IDC had similarly predicted (again without any evidence) that Windows Phone would arrest demand for iPhones by 2016.
Both were a simple endorsement of Microsoft's strategy, without any data backing up the idea that the company was really stoking any demand among buyers. A major focus of Windows 8 and Windows 10 had been the addition of touchscreen features and a Windows Phone ""Metro"" interface to forge a new PC category that was sort of iPad-MacBook, to take on both the iPad and MacBook, after failing to successfully take on either iPad or MacBook alone.  This all happened before
The Microsoft-IDC strategy of Detachables (aka the ""2in1"") worked out about as well as when Samsung applied the same logic in competing with Apple's iPhone and iPad by releasing its 2011 Galaxy Note, a middle-sized mobile device that was a large phone and a small tablet in one box. 
Critics hailed the new ""phablet"" and called it a success immediately after it shipped its first two million units. Yet like Microsoft's Detachables, interest was initially limited. And then once it appeared to be picking up steam, it ran into competition from Apple itself.
Apple launched its larger iPhone 6 models in 2014, crushing Samsung's high-end, larger phone business and forcing it into a much less profitable cheap territory of middle and lower-tier smartphones, where it has been stuck ever since. 
A year after launching its own larger iPhones, Apple debuted the new iPad Pro. In its first full quarter of sales it dominated the Detachable PC market Microsoft had been trying to build up over the previous three years.
If Apple had only been able to quash one huge multinational rival and strip bare its competitive strategy, that would have been impressive. But to deftly strike down both, just one year apart, forcing both the world's largest handset maker and the largest platform licensing company to scramble up expensive new survival strategies while writing off losses as Apple stood on their faces and raked in all the profits is really quite remarkable. Dispatching the PC Detachables
Last November, after years of hyping Detachables as the way Windows would take back the tablet market from iPads, IDC analysts noted that ""growth in the detachable tablet market has been slower than expected,"" adding that ""Apple and Microsoft are essentially the only two vendors supplying the category"" while ""other PC vendors champion the convertible PC form factor."" 
In other words, despite Microsoft's efforts to push Windows PC makers to build devices like its own Surface, those licensees preferred to build more conventional laptops with some tablet or touch features layered on top. That left Surface to be ""essentially"" the PC Detachable market. 
The following quarter, IDC reported that the premium Detachable segment of tablets had reached 6.5 million units, chalking up 10.3 percent growth over the previous holiday season. Given that Microsoft reported only $1.3 billion in revenues for all of its Surface devices, that means that Apple, ""essentially"" the only other vendor, sold most of those in the form of iPad Pro. 
The revenues Microsoft collected could only represent at best about 1.3 million Surface units (at an Average Selling Price of around $1,000). Further, the ten percent growth in Detachables that IDC reported certainly didn't come from Surface sales, because Microsoft's revenues over the holidays were virtually flat YoY.
On the other hand, Apple's holiday iPad revenues grew by ten times as much as Surface YoY while its holiday quarter iPad unit sales were flat. That means Apple's ASP increased, indicating that it sold a more premium mix of iPads, including the newly-refreshed mid-2017 iPad Pro models.
If Microsoft's Surface can't compete with iPad Pro, it makes it easy to see why other PC vendors are avoiding the same direct competition with Apple and instead marketing more conventional notebooks, a business they see as more secure and reliable.  Are tablets even relevant anymore?
Steve Jobs introduced iPad as a new device category between the iPhone and a notebook, noting that the only way it could stand on its own is if it could be much better at some tasks than either alternative.  
Apple wasn't trying to replace the Mac with iPads. Instead, it has increasingly presented iPad as a replacement for basic PCs, with Macs serving the demand for more powerful computing tools above it.
While IDC inadvertently documented the floundering waves of would-be iPad competitors for years, in retrospect it's now clear that iPad serves a role that cheap Android tablets can't. In fact, after glutting the market with loss leaders, cheap Android tablets have fallen drastically and keep shrinking.
On the other end, Windows PCs acting as tablets have also failed to blunt the rise of iPad. Windows 10 was supposed to displace iPad demand with devices that could run ""real"" Windows software, but we simply haven't seen this happening. PCs are shrinking alongside tablets globally.
In fact, the only thing that has really decreased the sales of iPad have been Apple's own larger iPhone models, which clearly did erode the demand for smaller iPad minis after those smaller tablets peaked in popularity in 2014. This actually worked out pretty well for Apple, because larger iPhones command a much higher price than small iPads, are more profitable, and have a shorter replacement cycle.
At the same time, Apple has more recently pushed iPad into a stronger role with the new iPad Pro and iOS enhancements that made it a more powerful multitasker. These models are now bumping up into what was once the low-end of Apple's MacBook range. And in turn, Apple's Mac notebooks have incremented up into higher-end tiers with pro features including Thunderbolt's ability to connect multiple 4K displays and high speed storage—something even Microsoft's most powerful Surface Studio 2 stationary PC can't do. Pew, Pew: tablets come out blazing
If there is any remaining doubt about the value of tablets after the collapse of cheap Androids, the fizzle of Windows RT, and the stagnant Surface, consider a detail of a recent study that was almost entirely overlooked. 
Last week, a Pew Research study on internet and social media use found that after ""long stretch of rapid growth in the United States,"" the number of people ""who go online, use social media or own key devices"" has plateaued over the last two years. This was widely reported. But there was one notable exception: a growth in tablet use. This wasn't widely reported.
While smartphones remained flat with a reported use by 77 percent of U.S. adults over the last two years, and desktop/laptop computers actually decreased from 78 to 73 percent of users, tablet use among American adults increased from 51 to 53 percent. 
That's a slower rate growth among tablet users since the survey began tracking tablets in 2010 (when just 3 percent reported using one), but it indicates that use in the U.S. continues to grow even as the global market for tablet sales decreases. 
Note that Apple's Mac sales are incrementing upward despite a significant drop in reported PC use over the last two years. Yet in tablets, use is increasing even as the market overall is shrinking. That strongly indicates that Apple is fueling that growth, in part by finding new uses for its tablets. 
For consumers and education, Apple produces its own apps (including Garage Band, iMovie, Keynote, and Swift Playgrounds) and works to help developers build tablet-optimized titles that don't exist for Android and Windows. In the enterprise, Apple has similarly worked to forge relationships with IBM, Salesforce, Cisco, Deloitte, SAP and others to build solutions around iOS. It has also pursued initiatives such as Apple Business Chat.
The fact that Apple is uniquely fostering adoption for iPads as a premium device and in the enterprise—rather than simply throwing out tablet hardware to see if anyone will buy it—is reflected in other data Pew compiled. 
While 53 percent of American adults use tablets, 58 percent of adults under 49 do. That indicates that tablets are even more popular among working age adults. Among users with a college education, tablet adoption had reached 66 percent. In households with an income of $75,000 or above, tablet adoption had reached 72 percent. 
These demographics of working age, educated and more affluent users also reported higher adoption of smartphones and laptops (surpassing 90 percent of users). Pew referred to these numbers as ""near saturation levels"" for these technologies. It's become clear that in many markets, everyone who wants a smartphone or laptop already has one, meaning that Apple is now largely selling replacements and Services to an installed base.
However, the high (but relatively lower) use of tablets—and their growth in use over the last two years—indicates that Apple still has a significant potential for selling iPads to new users even in the U.S. And in other countries, that demand is even higher. 
While Apple continues to step up its game in tablets, Microsoft has shifted its initial Surface portfolio from its initial, more tablet-like range to a series of devices that look and work more like a conventional notebook. It advertises Surface against MacBooks rather than iPads. Clearly, Microsoft doesn't see much potential in a pure tablet product. 
Google went even further, dumping its Pixel tablet strategy entirely—after PC vendors including Dell and HP first threw in the towel on their Android tablets. 
IDC still carefully avoids revealing its estimates for Apple's iPad Pro, or making any direct comparison to Microsoft's Surface sales, but at least the IDC's pantheon of iPad boogeymen have been put to rest for a more realistic appraisal of the tablet market—at least for now. It only took eight years."
Apple Insider,Apple distributes third developer beta of macOS 10.14.1 Mojave,10/08/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/08/apple-distributes-third-developer-beta-of-macos-10141-mojave,"Apple has issued its third developer beta of macOS 10.14.1 Mojave to developers enrolled in the company's testing program, with the latest build arriving one week after the second beta's release. 
The latest builds are available to download from the Apple Developer Center, but those who have previously installed the macOS 10.14.1 beta can also upgrade by going to using the ""Software Update"" facility in System Preferences. A public beta release is usually available shortly after the developer version, via the Apple Beta Software Program website or via the same Software Update feature. 
The third macOS 10.14.1 Mojave build is 18B57c, replacing the second beta's build of 18B50c. 
Relatively few details have been provided by Apple of what the update contains, but the biggest feature is arguably the return of Group FaceTime. Pulled from the betas before iOS 12 and Mojave's releases before being reintroduced for testing, Group FaceTime allows for up to 32 people to be involved in the same video conference. 
Apple is also introducing 70 new emoji, which is largely to be included as part of iOS 12.1, but will also have to be added to Apple's other operating systems, including macOS. AppleInsider, and Apple itself, strongly advise against installing beta releases on mission-critical hardware, due to the possibility of data loss and other issues. Those interested in testing the betas out should use non-essential devices, and to keep backups of any important data before installing or performing updates."
Apple Insider,"iOS 12.0.1 update available, fixes Wi-fi connectivity on iPhone XS, Lightning charging issues",10/08/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/08/ios-1201-update-available-fixes-wi-fi-connectivity-on-iphone-xs-lightning-charging-issues,"Apple has issued a sub-point release for iOS 12.0.1, knocking out a few bugs involving charging, Wi-Fi connectivity, and sporadic Bluetooth connections.
The update fixes a pair of relatively high-profile issues that were introduced in iOS 12. 
The first fix is to charging behavior. In rare occasions, an iPhone or iPad upgraded to iOS 12 didn't start charging when connected to a Lightning cable. The update also fixes a Wi-Fi connection issue, where the iPhone XS family of devices would re-connect to a mixed network on the slower 2.4 GHz band, even if a faster 5 GHz connection was available.
Other fixes include subtitling on video appearing properly, the restoration of the original "".?123"" key on the iPad keyboard, and a Bluetooth availability issue.
Both the Wi-Fi and charging issue fixes are included in the iOS 12.1 beta.
After months of beta testing, iOS 12 arrived on Sept. 17. The new OS features better performance for older devices, Augmented Reality and ARKit 2, new life balance tools, and tweaks to Siri, Photos and Apple News. It runs on devices dating back to the iPhone 5s."
Apple Insider,What to expect at Google's October 9 'Pixel 3' event in New York City,10/08/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/08/what-to-expect-at-googles-october-9-pixel-3-event-in-new-york-city,"Leaks make the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL look certain, but historically, Google's October events have seen releases of a slew of new hardware. AppleInsider talks about what you can expect to see —and what you shouldn't.
Google's much-anticipated hardware event will be on October 9 in New York City —and that is all the company has revealed. However, not only is this the annual event where new phones are announced, but 
This year, like most of the rest of them, there have been many leaks about the forthcoming phones from Google.
A last minute leak claims that the Pixel 3 XL is already on sale in at least one Hong Kong Shop.
Writing in Engadget, Richard Lai says: ""I borrowed the phone from Hong Kong mobile shop WahPhone Digital, which is actually offering this fully-boxed device for a mere HK$15,880 or around US$2,030.""
Lai is cautious but says he believes it's a legitimate early release. 
""Based on some system apps that I managed to install, this Pixel 3 XL is apparently powered by Qualcomm's flagship Snapdragon 845 chipset, but oddly enough, it only has 4GB of RAM,"" added Lai. ""I'm willing to bet that there's a higher-end version with maybe 6GB or more RAM. The screen resolution is listed as 2,960 x 1,440, but it's unclear what type of OLED panel is being used here —maybe LG's P-OLED again like last time, but a seemingly improved version even when viewed under the sun.""Pixel 3 design changes
This third generation of the Pixel phone is a high-end smartphone featuring reportedly minor design changes from the 2017 models. The larger Pixel 3 XL phone is expected to feature an iPhone-like notch at the top of the screen, but also a pronounced bezel at the bottom. Lai's report confirms this.
The smaller Pixel 3 doesn't feature a notch but has wide bezels at both top and bottom of the screen.
Both phones are expected to have glass backs to facilitate wireless charging. Unlike Apple's phones, though, the Pixel models are expected to have a fingerprint reader on the back glass. The back is also going to feature the phone's camera, with it likely retaining a single-lens design as in the Pixel 2 range.
The phones are also believe to be coming in at least black, white and a third color that's most likely to be pink or sandy.No Watch
Earlier this year, Android Wear was renamed Wear OS by Google. Director of Product Management Dennis Troper said that this change was to better reflect ""our technology, vision, and most important of all —the people who wear our watches.""
So, we're not expecting to see a Pixel Watch at this event. Google Director Engineering for Wear OS, Miles Barr, reportedly told press that the company has no plan to release a smartwatch this year.Tablet
It's more likely that we'll see what's expected to be called the Pixel Slate, a new Chrome OS tablet. Last year's event debuted a Pixelbook, a hybrid laptop and table.
There have been rumors of two new Pixelbook models, but it's anticipated that we'll see this Pixel Slate as the successor to the previous device.Speakers and screens
At the October 2017 event in San Francisco, Google released the Google Home Mini and Google Home Max smart speakers. They were aimed at the same market as Apple's HomePod and while the iPhone company has not updated its offering, Google's lineup may get an addition.
If rumors based on Google's filings to the FCC are correct and the device is ready for October 9's presentation, we should see a Google Home Hub. It will be a touchscreen smart display to allow you control the speakers through voice controls.
The Home Mini speaker is also expected to get bundled with a new Chromecast model to create a smart TV offering. Nothing else, maybe
Given that Google hasn't said anything about what will be in the event, we're ultimately guessing even if these guesses are based on FCC filings and leaks in the supply chain. 
So the company could pare the event down and speak only of the new Pixel phones. Or it could repeat last year when alongside these main releases there were many more Made By Google hardware products. 
Last year saw the Pixel Buds, wireless earphones, an updated Daydream View VR headset and the camera that automatically takes photos, Google Clips. 
The event will be streamed live on the Google YouTube channel at 11 a.m. Eastern, 8 a.m. Pacific on October 9.

Apple Insider,"No evidence of spy chips, Apple insists in letter to US Congress [u]",10/07/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/07/no-evidence-of-spy-chips-apple-insists-in-letter-to-us-congress,"Apple hasn't detected unusual transmissions or other evidence servers were infiltrated with Chinese spy chips, the company's VP of Information Security insisted in a letter to Congress on Sunday.Updated on Oct. 8 with the letter itself, as well as amplifying remarks by Apple
Apple's Vice President of Information Security George Stathakopoulos penned the letter stating that the allegations about the spy chip were made by a single source, and not by Bloomberg's claim of 17 corroborating sources.While the story was being reported, we spoke with Bloomberg's reporters and editors and answered any and all of their questions. We methodically dispelled the often-shifting nature of their claims. While we repeatedly asked them to share specific details about the alleged malicious chips that they seemed certain existed, they were unwilling or unable to provide anything more than vague secondhand accounts.
We were struck by the fact that the gravity and magnitude of the claims seemed to be undermined by their uncertainty around key details. Nevertheless, we worked tirelessly to ascertain whether these claims were true or, failing that, if anything even like them were true.
In the end, our internal investigations directly contradict every consequential assertion made in the article—some of which, we note, were based on a single anonymous source.
Apple has never found malicious chips, ""hardware manipulations"" or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any server. We never alerted the FBI to any security concerns like those described in the article, nor has the FBI ever contacted us about such an investigation.
Stathakopoulos promised to make himself available to brief Congressional staff.
Last Thursday, a Bloomberg report claimed that Chinese operatives had managed to sneak a microchip the size of a grain of rice onto 7,000 motherboards produced by Super Micro, which supplied those compromised parts for use in Apple's iCloud data centers. The chip, supposedly designed by the Chinese military, is said to have passed server data on to Chinese interests, and created a backdoor into public-facing networks.Bloomberg has stuck by its story, claiming that 30 companies were affected in all, another example being Amazon. The report took over a year to produce, and 17 sources, including people inside Apple.
Two government agencies — the Department of Homeland Security, and the U.K.'s GCHQ — have cast doubt on the allegations. The Chinese government is known to regularly probe U.S. government and corporate networks, though.
The U.S. National Security Agency has itself resorted to intercepting IT infrastructure such as Cisco routers."
Apple Insider,The new Mac Pro might get Intel's new 28-core 5 GHz Xeon processor,10/08/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/08/the-new-mac-pro-might-get-intels-new-28-core-5-ghz-xeon-processor,"Intel has revealed its upcoming collection of high-specification processors, including a 28-core Xeon processor for professional users alongside its 9th-generation Core processors boasting high core counts that could be heading for the Mac Pro, along with one eight-core model clocked at 5GHz. 
Unveiled at an event on Monday, the Xeon W-3175X is a 28-core, 56-thread chip that is intended for professional applications. While it has a base clock speed of 3.1GHz, the processor is capable of reaching to to 4.3GHz when boosted, and ships with an unlocked multiplier.
Offering a six-channel DDR4 memory controller, it is capable of supporting up to 512GB of memory. Aimed at content creators, the chip also includes 68 PCIe lanes, 44 of which are on the CPU, providing extensive connection opportunities to other hardware. 
All this performance also means it generates a lot of heat, with Intel stating it has a Thermal Design Point (TDP) of 265 Watts. 
The new model follows on from the Xeon W range launched last year, which included up to 18 cores on a single chip. At the time, it was thought the Xeon W family could be used on the iMac Pro. While the addition of a 28-core processor to the range may be attractive to some customers, the high heat generation would require considerably more cooling than the iMac Pro is able to provide. 
In theory, this makes the Xeon W-3175 a decent candidate for use in the upcoming refreshed Mac Pro. Apple previously revealed it was working on a modular-designed version that it was intending to bring out in 2018, and depending on the way it is constructed, it may be able to have enough cooling for the chip, if Apple ends up using it. 
Pricing for the Xeon W-3173X has yet to be announced, but it will be going on sale in December. Desktop Processors
Intel also introduced three processors under the 9th-generation masthead, headed up by an 8-core, 16-thread Core i9-9900K, which has a base clock speed of 3.6GHz rising to 5GHz under boost, dual-channel DDR4-2666 support, and 16MB of L3 cache.
It is joined by an 3.6GHz 8-core Core i7-9700K clockable to 4.9GHz under boost that lacks hyperthreading, but includes the same DDR4 support and 12MB of L3 cache. Lastly, there's the six-core Core i5-9600K with a base clock of 3.7GHZ and a boosted clock of 4.6GHz, and 9MB of L3 Cache. 
It is unlikely that Apple will be interested in these three processors, due to the trio all having a TDP of 95W, making it too hot for the iMac range and the MacBook Pro. Apple uses Xeon processors in the iMac Pro, not Core processors. 
Pre-orders are open now for the processors, priced at $488, $374, and $262 respectively, with pre-orders open today and the chips expected to ship on October 19th."
Apple Insider,Apple TV 4K could be used by big UK cable firm as set-top box,10/08/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/08/apple-tv-4k-could-be-used-by-big-uk-cable-firm-as-set-top-box,"Apple is reportedly in early-stage talks with the UK's BT over a potential new partnership, where customers of the EE broadband service could be offered an Apple TV to watch BT's own pay-TV channels, rather than using BT's existing set-top box. 
The discussions center around British Telecom's carrier and broadband supplier EE, reports the Telegraph, with the proposals involving BT providing EE customers with an Apple TV to use. The Apple TV would be preloaded with apps that would offer access to pay TV content produced by BT, such as BT Sport, as well as those of other broadcasters. 
There is already a relationship between Apple and EE, with the latter providing the Apple TV 4K for a monthly fee, but without a pay-TV element. Based on the report, the plan could alter this existing deal to add the preloaded channel apps. 
BT already competes with existing pay TV companies Sky and Virgin Media, and provides its BT Broadband customers a set-top box that uses the home broadband connection, with customers able to access many free-to-air channels alongside paid channel packages. BT Sport, BT's main self-operated channel, is also available to view via mobile apps and on other platforms, including the Apple TV.
Neither BT nor Apple have commented on the report. 
It is thought the deal is similar to the one made between Apple and Switzerland's Salt announced at WWDC 2018, with the telecoms and TV company offering the Apple TV as an alternative set-top box to customers. Similar deals have also been made with Canal+ in France, with Charter Spectrum also examining the concept of replacing traditional set-top boxes with the more compact Apple TV. 
The proposal is likely to be part of BT's consumer chief Marc Allera's strategy to partner with other technology companies to improve its services. Allera is said to have doubted that BT could compete with firms like Apple and Amazon in developing the company's own set-top boxes, with a switch to producing the software experience on other platforms likely to be an easier prospect than to maintain hardware."
Apple Insider,"YouTuber trolls Twitter in ""Beautygate"" sting using iPhone XS Max photos identified as Pixel 2 shots",10/08/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/08/youtuber-trolls-twitter-in-beautygate-sting-using-iphone-xs-max-photos-identified-as-pixel-2-shots,"YouTube personality Jonathan Morrison has used ""Beautygate"" to trick members of his audience to highlight bias against Apple's camera, by receiving compliments on social media for self portraits claimed to have been taken on the Google Pixel 2, but were in fact taken on the iPhone XS Max. 
Capitalizing on the current uproar over ""Beautygate,"" a phenomena with the iPhone XS and XS Max's front-facing camera that makes it appear there is aggressive skin smoothing filters applied to a self portrait, Jonathan Morrison took to Twitter and Instagram to share self portraits he claimed were taken on a different smartphone: the Google Pixel 2. 
The two images depicted Morrison in a vehicle and in a studio, with different lighting effects for each. While the Pixel 2 is identified as the smartphone that ""took"" the shots, there is no mention of Beautygate, iPhone, or other hardware by Morrison in any accompanying text, presumably to avoid directly asking followers to participate in a debate. 
The comments shortly after the images were published were largely complimentary towards the Pixel 2, with some users praising Google's smartphone for its quality, and others adding it looked better than the iPhone XS Max. Others mentioned the lack of a ""make-up effect,"" that it could easily be mistaken for a DSLR, it has the ""best portrait mode yet,"" and the joke hashtag #nobeautygate.  
In a video published on Sunday, Morrison revealed the deception, confirming the images were actually taken on an iPhone XS Max. 
""So I just wanted there to be a lesson out there, don't let a preconceived notion or headline skew your judgement, because clearly everyone who thought that was a Pixel automatically assumed that it was much better than the iPhone,"" comments Morrison, continuing ""when in fact that was the same iPhone XS Max that apparently had all of the Beautygate problems."" 
Morrison goes on to recap existing analysis of the iPhone XS Max's front-facing camera, where it is performing a high level of noise reduction to the image, so high that it affects the appearance of a subject's skin, rather than the application of a specific make-up filter. The effect is also more pronounced in odd lighting situations, as the camera app could increase the ISO, which in turn increases noise, requiring more noise reduction. 
It is possible that Apple will be making changes to how the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max's cameras perform filtering on images in a future software update, with AppleInsider sources confirming such activity is underway. For the moment, users should make sure there is adequate lighting before taking a selfie, if they want to minimize the effect."
Apple Insider,"Facebook Portal sets up video chat hardware fight with Amazon, Google",10/08/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/08/facebook-portal-sets-up-video-chat-hardware-fight-with-amazon-google,"Facebook has launched its own smart device in the form of the Portal —a pair of smart assistants specifically designed for connectivity through the social media venue.
Facebook has rolled out two models of the device, the Portal with a 10-inch 1280x800, and the Portal+ with a 15-inch 1920x1080 pivoting screen. The company claims that the device is ""powered by AI"" with features designed to ""take all of the guesswork out of video calling.""
The ""Smart Camera"" feature will pan and zoom to keep callers in the view of the screen. Background noise is filtered out with the ""Smart Sound"" algorithms in the device. The camera and microphone can be disabled with a tap, or in the case of the camera with a physical slider.
The video calls are handled through Facebook's Messenger service, allowing for calls to any mobile device with the app installed. Facebook notes that it ""doesn't listen to, view, or keep the contents of your Portal video calls."" Additionally, without delving into details, the company says that video calls on the Portal are encrypted.
Content for the device is provided by Facebook Watch, Food Network, Newsy, Spotify Premium, Pandora, and iHeartRadio. Amazon's Alexa can be used on the device, with all that entails including Amazon Prime music streaming. Facebook says that more partners for content will be announced soon.
It does not appear that the device has an unrestricted web browser. Additionally, it uses a locked version of Android, preventing users from installing apps not approved by Facebook.
Both models are available for pre-order now from Amazon, Best Buy and Facebook, with shipments at some point in November. The 10-inch Portal retails for $199, with the 15-inch Portal+ selling for $349. A bundle of two devices gets a $100 discount."
Apple Insider,Apple Watch Series 4 suffers from daylight savings bug rebooting loop in Australia,10/08/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/08/apple-watch-series-4-suffers-from-daylight-savings-bug-rebooting-loop-in-australia,"A number of Apple Watch Series 4 owners in Australia suffered from a rebooting issue with their new wearable devices over the weekend caused through a switch to daylight savings time, meanwhile an AppleInsider reader advises there's another timezone issue that apparently remains unresolved in watchOS. 
Users are reporting on Reddit and social media their Apple Watch stopped functioning properly on Sunday morning, shortly after the country moved into daylight savings time. Affected Apple Watch units were forced into a reboot loop, which consumed the battery and made it almost impossible to recharge or restart manually. 
A Reddit post about the problem offers the suggestion that the Infograph Activity complication may be the cause, with one user proposing switching a different watch face via the Watch app as a means to escape the reboot cycle. The same poster notes selecting the Infograph Modular face with the Activity complication in the Watch app even caused the app to close. 
It appears that the problem only occurs for the 24 hours following the daylight savings change, with users advising their once-affected devices are back to normal. 
While the issue is largely rectified for the moment, it is unclear if similar issues will occur when other markets change their clocks. The United States will be moving out of daylight savings time on November 4, while the UK and Europe changes on October 28. 
It is likely that Apple will issue a software update to close the bug, but it is unknown if it will make an appearance in time for the other time changes. 
The daylight savings issue is not the only time-related problem affecting the Apple Watch. A reader advised to AppleInsider of another problem specifically for the Apple Watch with Cellular, one that affects people on time zone borders. 
As the Apple Watch determines the time zone via cellular, it either acquires it from a connected iPhone or, if there is no iPhone present, by connecting to a nearby cell tower. 
According to the reader, who lives in Australia on a border between two states with different time zones and only one abides by daylight savings, this can cause problems for the cellular Apple Watch separated from its iPhone. Depending on the tower the Apple Watch connects to, it could be up to an hour out from the correct time for the reader's location, simply because the cell tower in question is in another time zone. 
A ""Senior AppleCare Specialist"" is said to have worked with the reader over the matter earlier this year, acknowledging the issue and that a software fix would be on the way, but it has yet to be issued. AppleInsider has contacted Apple for comment."
Apple Insider,$1.3 billion iPhone Safari cookie suit against Google shut down by UK courts,10/08/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/08/13-billion-iphone-safari-cookie-suit-against-google-shut-down-by-uk-courts,"Early Monday, London's High Court shut down a representative action —or class action —suit against Google that alleged that the company had illegally collected users' internet habits for tailored advertising purposes from 5.4 million iPhone users.
Judge Mark Warby blocked the case filed by ""Google You Owe Us,"" saying that the claims of damage were not supported by presented facts. Additionally, the judge found it impossible to accurately calculate the number of iPhone users that may have been impacted, or to what extend they may or may not have been affected, making a fair and just ruling impossible. 
The group sued Google in late 2017 over claims that the company intentionally worked around Safari security settings in 2012 that were blocking third-party tracking cookies. When the case launched in late 2017, the group claimed that as many as 5.4 million people may have been impacted. 
Representative actions in the UK are relatively rare, with the group claiming this to be the first of its kind against a major tech company concerning the ""alleged mass misuse of personal data."" Unlike US-style class actions, the UK's representative actions do not permit ""punitive"" damages that can inflate the levels of compensation, and are not conducted with a jury. 
Former Special Advisor to the Prime Minister Richard Lloyd helms the group. Lloyd is also a class member of the action, and representing all potential claimants, with support from law firm Mishcon de Reya. 
Lloyd was originally seeking 3.2 billion pounds ($4.3 billion), but had since cut that to 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion). Reportedly, 20,000 people had already signed up for the suit, but AppleInsider was unable to confirm this number.
""Today's judgment is extremely disappointing and effectively leaves millions of people without any practical way to seek redress and compensation when their personal data has been misused,"" Lloyd said in a statement. ""Google's business model is based on using personal data to target adverts to consumers and they must ask permission before using this data. The court accepted that people did not give permission in this case yet slammed the door shut on holding Google to account.""
Google had previously paid a total of $39.5 million in the US to settle claims that it had used the ""Safari Bypass"" to track iPhone users' internet habits. As part of the settlement, Google promised not to override any Web browser's cookie blocking features unless first given specific consent from the user, and to provide more information to consumers on how cookies work and how to use them.
""The Safari browser contained functionality that then enabled other Google advertising cookies to be set on the browser. We didn't anticipate that this would happen, and we have now started removing these advertising cookies from Safari browsers,"" Google said at the time. ""It's important to stress that, just as on other browsers, these advertising cookies do not collect personal information.""
An appeal of the UK ruling is expected."
Apple Insider,Watch: iPhone XS Max versus Samsung Galaxy Note 9 in audio test,10/07/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/07/watch-iphone-xs-max-versus-samsung-galaxy-note-9-in-audio-test,"When pitting the iPhone XS Max against Samsung's Galaxy Note 9 in a gaming death match last week, we noticed audio reproduction was noticeably better on Apple's device. We take a closer listen in this video.
In introducing iPhone XS last month, Apple said it reworked the smartphone's speaker system to boost stereo separation. Exactly how the company went about achieving that goal is unclear, but the results are readily apparent. 
This test compares the iPhone XS Max with Samsung's Galaxy Note 9. We positioned a boom microphone a good distance away from both phones and evaluated raw unedited audio to determine how the two handsets differ. 
Dolby Atmos is active on the Note 9, while the XS Max has no additional effects applied.
Playing our favorite song, we noticed the iPhone XS Max is markedly louder, and the highs are brighter. Not only that, but the bass is a lot punchier. 
Listening closer, the iPhone XS Max presents a wider soundstage with more separation between the notes, whereas the Note 9 sounds a bit flat. 
Moving onto the second part of the test, Fortnite gameplay, both phones were set to maximum volume. Again, the iPhone XS Max sound output blows the Galaxy Note 9 away, making for a much better gaming experience. Deals on the iPhone XS Max and Galaxy Note 9
If you haven't already ordered Apple's iPhone XS Max, wireless carriers are incentivizing the purchase. Want to get your hands on a new device asap? eBay sellers are also shipping units now.Carrier deals:AT&T Wireless: Buy one iPhone XS or iPhone XS Max, get a second $700 off when you add a line.Verizon Wireless: Get up to $300 off with an eligible trade.Sprint: Get the 64GB iPhone XS for $0 per month with eligible trade-in and Sprint Flex lease.T-Mobile: Save up to $300 on the iPhone XS with an eligible iPhone trade.

Apple Insider,Department of Homeland Security chimes in on iCloud server spy chip allegations,10/07/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/07/department-of-homeland-security-chimes-in-on-icloud-server-spy-chip-allegations,"The United States Department of Homeland Security has added to the growing chorus of voices siding with Apple and Amazon versus the blockbuster report that Apple's iCloud and Siri security was violated by a China-planted spy chip.
The statement, issued by DHS on Saturday doesn't delve into any detail about why it believes that the Bloomberg report from Thursday is flawed, and sides with Apple and Amazon in the matter. The Department of Homeland Security is aware of the media reports of a technology supply chain compromise. Like our partners in the UK, the National Cyber Security Centre, at this time we have no reason to doubt the statements from the companies named in the story.
Information and communications technology supply chain security is core to DHS's cybersecurity mission and we are committed to the security and integrity of the technology on which Americans and others around the world increasingly rely.  
Just this month - National Cybersecurity Awareness Month - we launched several government-industry initiatives to develop near- and long-term solutions to manage risk posed by the complex challenges of increasingly global supply chains.  These initiatives will build on existing partnerships with a wide range of technology companies to strengthen our nation's collective cybersecurity and risk management efforts.
Thursday's story claimed Chinese operatives managed to sneak a microchip the size of a grain of rice onto 7000 motherboards produced by Supermicro, which supplied those compromised parts for use in Apple's iCloud data centers. The chip, supposedly designed by the Chinese military, allegedly passed the data on the servers to Chinese interests, and gave a back-door into Apple's public-facing networks to the alleged perpetrators. 
After the report was published, both Apple and Amazon issued strongly worded statements very specifically refuting the claims. The denial, and continued clarifications after the fact goes well beyond anything Apple has distributed. Apple continues to categorically deny all assertions in Bloomberg's story, and offers point-by-point rebuttal to certain facts and figures.Bloomberg is standing by its investigation —claiming 30 companies were affected, but only naming two —saying the report took more than a year to compile and involved more than 100 interviews. The publication cites 17 sources from government agencies and companies involved in the alleged hack, including senior insiders at Apple.At least one of Bloomberg's sources appears to have changed its mind after publication."
Apple Insider,"What iOS 12 'critical alerts' are, and how to turn them on",10/07/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/07/what-ios-12-critical-alerts-are-and-how-to-turn-them-on,"Many of iOS 12's notification features are intended to remove distractions, but ""critical alerts"" are meant to do the opposite. Apple hasn't said much about them — so what are they, and how do they work?
On a basic level, critical alerts appear regardless of what you're doing in iOS or what other notification settings you might have enabled. They ignore Do Not Disturb mode, and even ringer settings, so you can't accidentally mute them.
As you might imagine though these could be abused by unscrupulous developers, so they're opt-in only and developers have to seek approval from Apple. The company vets notifications so that only ones related to health, public safety, and home security are supported. One example it offers is a glucose monitoring app, which might push out a warning that your blood sugar is too low.
Typically an app that supports critical alerts will trigger a pop-up asking you to allow them, much like the messages that ask for access to contacts or the camera.
Chances are that will be the extent of your interaction, but you can flip alerts off and on at will. Open the Settings app, select Notifications, and then scroll down until you find the app in question. If it supports the feature, you'll see a special Allow Critical Alerts toggle at the top of the app's notification dashboard."

Apple Insider,What the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max are really doing to your selfies,10/06/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/06/what-the-iphone-xs-and-iphone-xs-max-are-really-doing-to-your-selfies,"You may have heard some talk about the so-called and poorly-named ""Beautygate,"" where users are claiming Apple's new iPhone XS and XS Max are applying overly-aggressive skin smoothing algorithms on photos taken with the selfie camera, resulting in fake-looking or doctored images. Let's talk about what's actually happening behind the scenes.
With the new iPhone XS and XS Max, Apple introduced a brand new feature called Smart HDR. The new camera mode is designed to increase dynamic range, which is basically the difference between the darkest and lightest tones that a camera can capture. 
In our iPhone X vs XS Max Photo comparison, you can see how far Smart HDR seriously increases the dynamic range on the XS Max. 
Comparing similar photos taken on the iPhone X and iPhone XS Max, the X's image shows the face and body of the subject are properly exposed, but the highlights in the background are blown out, which means they're so bright that the details, including the colors, are lost. 
On the XS Max, all of the details and texture are visible, and the colors are accurately reproduced. Not only that, but in an examination of the shadows, the areas appear brighter and with more detail. 
Turning to the pants on each image, it appears like there's a smoothing effect being applied on the XS Max.
If you look at a selfie photo taken in low light, the effect is even more pronounced. There's two main reasons why this is happening, and they're both related to Apple's new Smart HDR feature. How Smart HDR works
With a regular HDR photo on last year's iPhone X, the camera will snap three photos, taking one exposed for the face, one for the highlights and one for the shadows. It then blends the best parts of those images into one photo.
Professional photographers sometimes reproduce the technique and manually blend images together in a program like Adobe Lightroom, resulting in a photo with incredible detail and dynamic range.
With Apple's new Smart HDR, it all starts with something Apple calls ""zero shutter lag."" Basically, whenever your camera app is open, the A12 Bionic processor is constantly shooting a 4 frame buffer. It's effectively taking photos over and over again, very quickly, then holding the last 4 frames taken in the system memory without actually saving them to your camera roll.
When you actually do hit the shutter button, you get a photo instantly, since it grabs one of the frames from the buffer. Not only that, but the A12 Bionic also captures a variety of frames at different exposures at the same time, just like regular HDR. 
It then analyzes and merges the best frames together into one photo, which has seriously great dynamic range.
All of this has to happen very quickly, and it's all down to the new front-facing and rear-facing sensors. The new sensors most likely have increased readout speed, making it quicker to capture those frames. 
The ability to shoot 1080P at 60 frames per second on the front-facing camera is evidence of a new sensor with a faster readout. This is why Apple probably won't give the iPhone X Smart HDR in a future software update. 
However, there's another limitation: shutter speed, which is basically the amount of time the camera shutters open to allow light into the sensor. With a very fast shutter speed, less light has a chance to get into the sensor. 
Since Apple's new Smart HDR requires everything to happen very quickly, the shutter speed needs to be faster, so as not to slow down the process. Due to this, less light gets into the sensor, which can hamper brightness in the image. 
To compensate, the camera increases the ISO, which basically dictates how sensitive the sensor is to light. A consequence of increasing system ISO is that it also increases noise. 
According to a deep-dive into the new iPhone XS camera system, Halide developer Sebastiaan de With discovered the new iPhone appears to favor fast shutter speeds and higher ISO levels. He believes the behavior is linked to capturing the best possible content for Smart HDR processing, even when the feature is not enabled. 
In bright sunlight, users won't notice much of a difference since the image may already be perfectly exposed. In a low light scenario, the ISO needs to be turned up pretty high, which introduces a lot of noise. 
To compensate, Apple adds noise reduction processing to the images. 
The most common drawback to noise reduction is that details start to lose their sharpness and look soft, basically what is being called skin smoothing. 
The reason the skin smoothing effect is more noticeable on the front-facing camera is because the sensor is a lot smaller than the one on the rear, so even less light has a chance to get in. 
So no, Apple isn't applying a beauty filter. The smoothed out areas are mostly due to added noise reduction introduced as a result of new camera behaviors likely related to the Smart HDR feature. If we compare a low-light photo from the XS Max to something like the Galaxy Note 9, we'll see that the Note 9 is applying noise reduction as well, leading to a similar beauty mode effect. Pronouncement
This only explains half of the overall beautygate puzzle. The second half deals with why the effect is even more pronounced.  
As Smart HDR is taking more frames at different exposures and combining them, it's able to have more high-light and low-light detail than ever before. However, when merging those images together, the photo becomes more balanced and there is an overall decrease in contrast throughout the whole image.
It works the same when shooting video on a professional camera. When filming in a flat profile, there's initially a lot less contrast, but it holds a lot more detail in both the shadows and highlights. 
After adding some contrast back in, the image looks just as sharp and has better dynamic range. 
Looking at photos from the iPhone X and the XS Max, it seems as though the iPhone X's photo is sharper, but if you look closely, it's actually not. The reason the photo looks sharper is because it has more contrast.
Contrast is basically the difference in brightness between objects in a photo, and in this example, the bottom half isn't any sharper, it just has added contrast.
A similar effect was found when comparing the XS Max to the Samsung Galaxy Note 9. The photos and video on the XS Max lacked contrast and looked less sharp compared to the Note 9. 
In this selfie comparison, the iPhone X's image has more contrast, making it look more detailed. 
The iPhone XS Max's lack of contrast makes it look like there's some kind of skin smoothing effect being applied, but if we add some contrast back in, that effect starts to melt away.
So it's actually the lack on contrast that makes it seem like the skin is softer when in a well-lit environment. Changes are possible
Technically, Apple would just need to tweak the software to resolve the issue if it so chooses. That will take care of the contrast part of the puzzle, but as for noise reduction, that's something that happens on basically every phone's selfie camera in low-light conditions. 
As for Smart HDR, Apple can tune the feature to make it work slower, allowing the shutter to stay open a bit longer, but of course, that'll reduce the dynamic range performance on the XS and XS Max' new cameras."
Apple Insider,Exploit the power of iOS 12 and your new iPhone XS with these ten apps,10/06/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/06/exploit-the-power-of-ios-12-and-your-new-iphone-xs-with-these-ten-apps,"You've got a new phone, now make it work hard for you. With every iPhone update there comes a flood of new iOS apps and upgrades. Some of them are essentials, some just show what the new iOS is capable of —and a very few are both. AppleInsider picks the ten most notable new or significantly updated apps.
For yourself, there are apps that are more like essential tools that should be on your iPhone —and some of them already are. This week's highlighted apps, though, are all ones that are brilliant at demonstrating to others what the iPhone XR, XS and XS Max can do. These include updates to AirMeasure, Evernote, WaterMinder, Things, Citymapper, Drafts, PCalc, Halide Camera, Overcast and 1Password. AirMeasure 1.9.5
Next time someone asks you why you spent so much money on a phone, show them this. Apple already provides a measuring tool in iOS 12 and you know how impressive that is, but it just looks like a line with a dot on it. Use this third-party alternative instead and whoever you're with will see a familiar tape-measure on the screen. 
Also unlike Apple's tool, this one can be used to measure buildings from a distance so you can settle arguments over whether your neighbor has exceeded planning permission or not.
Speaking of neighbors, AirMeasure can also tell you their height before you decide to get into too big an argument with them.
Get it for iOS: $0.99. Requires iOS 10.0 or later and iOS 12 for the latest features.Evernote 8.16.3
Fresh from a recent visual overhaul of the iPhone and iPad app, Evernote has come out with an iOS 12 update that only adds Siri Shortcuts —but adds it very well.
Now whenever you search for a note in Evernote, the app displays the results plus a button for creating a Siri Shortcut. Tap that, record a voice phrase and from now on you can tell Siri to do that Evernote search for you. 
That works on the titles of notes regardless of which version of Evernote you have. If you've got the paid Premium edition, though, the search also works on the contents of notes.
Plus you can then pick a note and tell Siri to make a PDF out of it.
Get it for iOS: Free with optional premium subscription. Requires iOS 10.3 or later. and iOS 12 for the Siri Shortcuts. WaterMinder 3.7.2
This is a health app that tracks your water intake. It's already a very visual tool with each glass of water you have being shown as an amount of liquid filling up an outline body. Only, it used to be entirely dependent on you remembering to open the app and report what you've just drunk.
Now with iOS 12, WaterMinder comes with some pre-baked Siri Shortcuts so that you can tell Siri to ""Log 500ml of water"" and that will be entered into your daily intake. It's particularly smart at offering shortcuts that match the preferred measurement units you've set.
Get it for iOS: $4.99. Requires iOS 9 or later and iOS 12 for Siri Shortcuts. Things 3.7.2
All To Do apps have the problem that you don't always record your tasks in them. Things and rivals such as OmniFocus are predicated on making task entry so fast that you never put it off to later. For iOS 12, Things 3 has adopted Siri Shortcuts.
You've long been able to use Siri to add to Apple's Reminders app and then have Things automatically retrieve those tasks into its own database. It worked and we didn't complain, but now you can skip this workaround completely. Just tell Siri that you want to add a task to Things and say what it is.
Similarly, you can now get Things to show you individual lists such as the one for your shopping, the one for your bridge building project. If you bump into Al in the street, you can tell Things to show you all the To Do tasks you've tagged as needing to be discussed with him.
Get it for iOS: $9.99 for the iPhone version. The separate iPad version costs $19.99 and there's a Mac edition for $49.99 which has been updated for macOS Mojave. 
Requires iOS 10 or later and iOS 12 for Siri Shortcuts.  Citymapper 7.115.247
The very first Siri Shortcut we tried was saying ""Next Bus"" and having Citymapper tell us when that was, where the nearest bus stop is and the times of the next few departures. 
Citymapper is a transit app and if you set where your home and work locations are, you can then also ask it to detail today's journey to the office.
We then added it into convoluted Siri Shortcuts that combined bus information from Citymapper with geographic data from Apple Maps and train itinerary news from TripIt. While we were within an area that Citymapper covers, and while we had a forthcoming departure listed in the TripIt travel service, it worked brilliantly.
Only, Citymapper does not cover every region. It's currently in 39 cities around the world so make sure you're also in one of them before you breezily ask it to ""check my commute"".
Get it for iOS: Free. Requires iOS 10.0 or later and iOS 12 for Siri Shortcuts. Drafts 5.4.1
Drafts is a plain-text editor whose chief benefit is how you can start writing the instant you open it: there's no creating a new document or naming one. Then if you go for the paid subscription version, you also get a second boon which is what are called Drafts Actions. You can automate sending your text out as an email, a Message or part of a much more complex workflow.
Now with iOS 12, you can of course use Siri Shortcuts. Even with the free version of Drafts, you can say ""Capture clipboard"" and the app will create a new note with the contents of the system clipboard. So if you're compiling information from a variety of places, you can select-and-copy it and then get Siri Shortcuts to file it away in Drafts.
If you have the paid version with access to all of Drafts' Actions, then you can do more such as telling the app to start taking dictation. 
Get it for iOS: Free with optional pro subscription from $1.99 per month. Requires iOS 11.0 or later and iOS 12 for Siri Shortcuts.PCalc 3.8.2
It's just a calculator yet for a decade or more, if you wanted to see new Apple technology in action, this has been the app to try. That's as well as it being a first-class calculator that features every science and math functions you can think of. It's even got one you might not have thought of: Reverse Polish Notation. Try that once on PCalc and you'll be hooked.
Naturally, then, PCalc has adopted Siri Shortcuts but it has done so just remarkably, even astonishingly well. There isn't a single function in the entire app that you can't use in Siri Shortcuts —and while that's impressive, it's not what's superb.
What's superb is how PCalc exploits Siri Shortcuts to the full and then works around issues Apple's software can't yet do. Siri Shortcuts is really only for issuing commands: you say something and an app gives you back a text, verbal or visual result. Apps can't ask you a question and listen for the answer, for instance. 
What apps can do, though, is work with your iOS clipboard and PCalc does that. Copy a number and you can then tell Siri Shortcuts to do something with it.
Say you're writing an email demanding money in US dollars and for some reason need to know what that is in Britain's pound Sterling. Write the dollar amount, select and copy it, then you can say something like ""Convert that"" —and PCalc will.
Get it for iOS: $9.99. Requires iOS 9.0 or later and iOS 12 for Sir Shortcuts.Halide Camera 1.9.1
If your friends are now weary of you talking to your phone and expecting them to be wowed by all that it can do, try them on something visual instead. Halide Camera is an alternative to Apple's own photography app and it aims to bring professional tools to everyone. 
Consequently most of the clearest benefits of Halide will be visible just to you as you're composing a shot. That means you get fast switching between all of the options that your iPhone's camera lens is able to give you. And showing people the results you get from even a quick snap will at least intrigue them.
To convert them into fellow Halide fans, swipe your finger across an image you've taken and show them how you can both quickly and finely make improvements.
Or set your iPhone up on a tripod, walk away from it and casually call back ""Hey, Siri, take the shot"". Halide can instantly take a photograph when you do this with an iPhone XS.
Get it for iOS: $5.99. Requires iOS 11.0 or later and iOS 12 for Siri Shortcuts.Overcast 5.01
Apple's own Podcasts app is not the company's most popular software but it works and until now it's also had an advantage none of its rivals have. You can be driving and call out to Siri to play a certain podcast. Say its name and Apple's Podcasts will play it. No other podcast player was plugged into Siri like that —until now.
Now Overcast gets that feature by how you can set up voice commands that only work within it. Tell Siri Shortcuts that when you say ""Next Podcast"" you want to involve Overcast's Skip feature and that's what you've got.
It's provided quite a fine degree of control into Siri Shortcuts. So you can skip episodes, but you can also change the playback speed and turn an audio boost feature on or off. 
Get it for iOS: Free with optional annual subscription. Requires iOS 12 or later. 1Password 7.2
Possibly you shouldn't go around showing everyone this app but that's because as excellent as it is, it's entire job is to keep your passwords and credit card numbers safe. If you really trust these friends of yours, though, show them how AutoFill works.
This is an iOS 12 feature that binds password managers such as 1Password into the system just a little bit more. Now if you are logging into a website or opening an app that requires a password, iOS 12 will offer you the option of entering one you've got stored in 1Password. 
Beyond how it plugs into iOS 12, the 1Password app now also keeps itself in sync with the 1Password service whether or not you open either of them. So long as you've signed in to the service in the app, you now know that your passwords are up to date regardless of when you changed any on, say, the iPad edition.
Get it for iOS: Free to download but thereafter is a subscription service starting from $3.99 per month. Requires iOS 12 or later.

Apple Insider,"Apple launched investigation into Bloomberg's China hack claims, 'found nothing'",10/05/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/05/apple-launched-investigation-into-bloombergs-china-hack-claims-found-nothing,"Apple reportedly launched a wide-reaching internal investigation into an explosive report claiming Chinese spies compromised its servers in what boils down to a complex supply chain hack, but came up empty in its examination. 
Citing multiple high-ranking Apple executives who spoke on the matter anonymously, BuzzFeed News reports the company conducted a ""massive, granular, and siloed investigation"" into claims leveled in a recent Bloomberg Businessweek report. The Bloomberg story, published Thursday, alleges servers used by nearly 30 tech firms including Apple and Amazon were compromised as part of an elaborate Chinese intelligence operation uncovered in 2015.
Not only did Apple's investigation find no evidence of the hardware tampering in question, but it also failed to identify unrelated incidents that could have contributed to Bloomberg's claims, the report said. 
""We tried to figure out if there was anything, anything, that transpired that's even remotely close to this,"" a senior Apple security executive said, according to BuzzFeed News. ""We found nothing.""
A security engineer involved in the investigation said they had never seen a microchip resembling the component described in the Bloomberg report. 
Thursday's story claimed Chinese operatives managed to sneak a microchip the size of a grain of rice onto motherboards produced by Supermicro, which supplied the parts for use in Apple's iCloud data centers. The chip, supposedly designed by the Chinese military, was said to act as a ""stealth doorway onto any network"" and offered ""long-term stealth access"" to attached computer systems. 
""I don't know if something like this even exists,"" the unnamed Apple engineer said. The person went on to note that Bloomberg did not produce material for Apple to examine in efforts to corroborate the report. ""We were given nothing. No hardware. No chips. No emails.""
Another Apple executive, a senior member of the company's legal team, said it had not been in contact with government agencies purportedly investigating the matter. Bloomberg in its report claims Apple informed the FBI of ""suspicious chips"" found in Supermicro servers around May 2015 after ""detecting odd network activity and firmware problems.""
The executive reiterated Apple's public statement on the matter, saying the company is not bound by a confidentiality agreement or gag order. 
Apple appears to have exhausted all avenues in its investigation, and sources told BuzzFeed News the company believes there is little else it can do at this juncture. 
Just hours after the Bloomberg report was published, both Apple and Amazon issued strongly worded statements refuting the claims in no uncertain terms. As BuzzFeed News points out, the denial is unlike anything Apple has distributed, including a precisely worded counter to claims that it participated in the U.S. government's PRISM surveillance program in 2013. The company uses broad language to categorically deny all assertions in Bloomberg's story, and offers point-by-point rebuttal to certain facts and figures.
Amazon's response struck a similar tone.
For its part, Bloomberg is standing by its investigation, saying the report took more than a year to compile and involved more than 100 interviews. The publication cites 17 sources from government agencies and companies involved in the alleged hack, including senior insiders at Apple.
With both sides refusing to stand down the issue has become a matter of ""he said, she said."" It is unclear how, or even if, the allegations can be disproven, as Bloomberg has yet to produce conclusive evidence of the scheme beyond information from anonymous sources."
Apple Insider,"iFixit finds third-party MacBook Pro and iMac Pro repairs still an option, at least for now",10/05/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/05/ifixit-finds-third-party-macbook-pro-and-imac-pro-repairs-still-an-option-at-least-for-now,"In the wake of revelations that Apple plans to employ a special diagnostics tool that effectively blocks certain third-party MacBook Pro and iMac Pro repairs, DIY specialist iFixit evaluated the issue to find the new policy is not yet active. 
On Thursday, leaked Apple support network documents outlined a new process Authorized Service Providers must follow when repairing Macs containing the T2 security chip, currently limited to the 2018 MacBook Pro and iMac Pro. 
Specifically, Apple said repair personnel must run proprietary system configuration software, ""Apple Service Toolkit 2,"" after replacing the display assembly, top case, logic board or Touch ID board of a MacBook Pro and the logic board or flash storage on an iMac Pro. Failure to run the software suite renders the host system inoperable, Apple says. 
According to iFixit, however, the repair policy is not yet in effect. In evaluating Apple's claims, the DIY firm purchased a new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and proceeded to swap displays with an identical MacBook Pro model subjected to its annual teardown in July. iFixit also updated the older machine to macOS Mojave and traded logic boards. 
In each scenario, both MacBook Pro models functioned normally following the repairs. 
""Our guess is that this software tracks serial numbers and other parts data so Apple can verify AASPs are correctly completing repairs,"" iFixit said in a blog post. ""It may also perform calibration, or it could simply be a way of keeping their authorized network in line. Basically it means Apple owns your device, not you, and could conceivably disable it remotely if they detect unauthorized repairs going on.""
The firm goes on to say the AST 2 procedure might be a system for tracing parts used in Apple's authorized repair network. Alternatively, it could be a method by which Apple can monitor the quality of repairs or track replacement rates. 
""It's possible that units with swapped parts may operate normally, but still report a failure in Apple diagnostic tests for having unauthorized' components installed—much like earlier units did on earlier versions of AST for third party HDD/SSD, RAM and batteries,"" iFixit said. 
The new policy was widely reported after its disclosure Thursday, with some voicing concern that AST 2 played into so-called ""planned obsolescence"" strategies. Depending on how the system rolls out, Apple can, for example, discontinue repair support eligibility for T2-equipped machines when they reach end-of-life, forcing customers to buy a new machine. 
Others, including iFixit, ponder how Apple's strategy impacts — or might be impacted by — ""right to repair"" legislation being readied in a number of U.S. states. The laws seek to force tech companies like Apple to provide consumers and third-party repair outlets access to repair information, diagnostic equipment and parts."
Apple Insider,Apple's A12 Bionic comes close to desktop CPU performance in benchmarks,10/05/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/05/apples-a12-bionic-comes-close-to-desktop-cpu-performance-in-benchmarks,"Performance improvements in the A12 Bionic chip used in the iPhone XS and the iPhone XS Max has put Apple's in-house CPU designs on a par with processors used in notebooks and computers, one extensive deep dive declares, with the latest processor bringing the mobile chip line within striking distance of ""the best desktop CPUs.""
The thorough benchmarking and examination of the iPhone XS and XS Max by Anandtech examined how the A12 Bionic compares to other processors, including its predecessor the A11, Samsung's Exynos 9810 and 8895, and Qualcomm's Snapdragon 845 and 835 chips. 
SPEC2006, the benchmark applied to all of the processors, is said to be an ""important industry standard benchmark"" that uses significantly larger and more complex datasets than others, far bigger than the popular GeekBench 4. The benchmark is believed to be a better test, due to its ability to offer more details for the microarchitecture in relation to memory subsystem performance. 
While admitting it to be the first time in over two years that the publication is using SPEC2006 on an iOS device, it is also declared the figures produced in the tests are estimates, due to not being submitted or officially validated by SPEC. 
The benchmark recorded the energy usage for a given workload, as well as the performance. Generally speaking, the less energy is used and the more performance offered, the better. 
Compared to the A11, the A12 clocks at 5 percent higher in the majority of workloads, with a special mention for the SPECint2006 test, which showed a 24-percent increase. In other tests, the ""astounding performance gains"" rose from 30 to 42 percent, with the suggestion ""the new cache hierarchy and memory subsystem has greatly paid off here as Apple was able to pull off one of the most major performance jumps in recent generations."" 
For power efficiency, the A12 scored a 12-percent improvement on the A11, but with 12 percent less energy usage at peak performance. 
Under the SPECfp2006 testing, the average performance gain was 28 percent, though under the 433.milc test, this rose to 75 percent. 
One test, 470.lbm, is said to be interesting for Apple's chips, as they showcase ""multi-factor performance advantages"" over ARM and Samsung cores. It is posited Apple's microarchitecture is able to optimize by having larger instruction loop buffers, where the core would bypass decode stages in a loop iteration and fetch instructions from the buffer, saving time. It is also thought the vector execution of Apple's cores may be benefiting it in this test. 
As a consequence of running the SPEC2006 benchmark tests, it has revealed how close the A11 and A12 are to the performance of desktop processors, with the A12 noted as outperforming a Skylake-based chip tested a few months ago. 
While admitting to compiler differences and other considerations that need to be taken into account, the report notes ""we're now talking about very small margins until Apple's mobile SoCs outperform the fastest desktop CPUs in terms of ST performance."" 
Later in the report, the Vortex CPU's memory subsystem is credited with providing the A12 a significant performance boost in a lot of workloads, adding that Apple's marketing department is ""really underselling the improvements here by quoting 15,"" with the site's estimated improvement for the chip being around 40 percent. 
The A12 is a six-core CPU featuring two performance cores, which Apple claims is 15 percent faster than the A11, while consuming 40 percent less power. Four efficiency cores handle lower-intensity tasks, and in theory consume half the energy in comparison to the A11."
Apple Insider,The Apple versus Microsoft hardware double-standard rears up again with the latest Surface update,10/05/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/05/the-apple-versus-microsoft-hardware-double-standard-rears-up-again-with-the-latest-surface-update,"Across the last couple years, Apple's new Macs have been roundly criticized for raising their prices using flashy —rather than purely utilitarian—new features like the Touch Bar, while delivering only incremental improvements in performance due to a reliance on Intel's processors. Yet when Microsoft follows the same playbook, suddenly high prices are reasonable, flashy but unnecessary features are a sign of innovation, and big performance gains aren't really necessary. 
This week, Microsoft bumped up the specs of its Surface Studio 2, its all-in-one PC that converts into a huge stationary tablet. It's been two years since the original revision shipped.
In the fashion of Apple, Microsoft boasted that the new machine was the ""fastest Surface ever,"" as if it were competing against others making inferior Surface models, or that it needed to reassure the tech media that new computers are not suddenly getting slower each year after forty years. 
Microsoft couldn't claim it is the fastest Windows PC, however. In fact, writing for PC World, Mark Hachman noted in his hands on, titled ""Microsoft Surface Studio 2: Still the PC you desire but can't afford,"" that even calling it the fastest Surface ""may be true in the end, though Microsoft barely squeaks by with that definition on paper.""PC nostalgia for yesterday's Mac
Microsoft will use Intel's seventh generation Core i7 chip, just like Apple's fastest standard iMac introduced in mid-2017. But rather than complaining that Microsoft's brand new Surface Studio 2 should be using Intel's latest available processor, Hachman stated, ""fortunately, performance isn't why you'll buy the Microsoft Surface Studio 2: It's that amazing, vibrant display.""
That's right: after decades of chiding Apple for not building a ""headless"" PC box from the '90s, suddenly the reason ""you'll buy the Microsoft Surface Studio 2"" —and don't worry, you actually won't —is because it incorporates a nice display. 
Specifically, as Hachman detailed, a ""4500x3000 28-inch RealSense display [that] puts out even more light than before—over 500 nits!"" He added that ""it was like falling into a more vibrant, colorful world."" 
Alternatively, you might say it's like walking into the summer of 2017, when Apple released its 5K iMac with 500 nits of brightness at 5128 by 2880 —higher than the Surface Studio 2. Plus, that iMac display is in a more media-creative friendly 16:9 aspect ratio. 
To speak of this stuff as being ""more than ever before"" and a new epoch of computing is just kind of nutty.What the people want
The Studio does offer its novel ""easel mode"" that turns its display into a panel you can write on using a special stylus, effectively making it a larger version of an iPad Pro without the mobility. If it were indeed 2015, we wouldn't have any proof whether people preferred using the conventional workstation format of the 5K iMac; the then-new, ultra-mobile iPad Pro with its Pencil for direct annotations, or the in-between Surface Studio hybrid that Microsoft shipped a year later at the end of 2016.
Nearly two years later however, we know unequivocally that the 5K iMac is a hit ultimately contributing to Apple releasing an ultra-premium, super beefy version called iMac Pro. Plus, the iPad Pro has been the most successful premium tablet by a huge margin, while Surface Studio has been little more than concept so ineffectual that it has had no discernible impact on the number of Surface devices Microsoft has been selling since its arrival.
Sales of the Surface haven't grown out of the range they've been stuck in for years.  
Despite being a moderate upgrade that has only ""finally"" arrived after two years of the original Surface Studio, Tom Warren of the Verge wrote that ""Microsoft has strangely decided to stick with a 7th Generation Intel Core i7 processor,"" and that ""Microsoft isn't revealing exactly when this new Surface Studio 2 will launch."" The expectation is that Surface Studio 2 will ship in December when Nvidia can deliver the faster GPU it uses. 
Microsoft has priced the Surface Studio 2 at a very high tier —it starts at $3,500, with nothing underneath it in the Surface lineup apart from its three mobile products. That's $200 more than Apple's 27 inch iMac upgraded to a Core i7, 16GB of DDR4 RAM and 1TB of SDD storage at Apple's premium prices.
Apple is known —and often reviled by PC fans —for its premium pricing. Yet in this case, an iMac is not just cheaper when similarly configured, but offers a wide range of significantly lower priced options starting at $1,800 for the 5K iMac, or $1,100 for the smaller 4K model where Microsoft does not. 
That indicates that Microsoft doesn't expect to sell many Studio 2 units to buyers outside of a very small group that will pay whatever it asks. 
So talking about Surface as being ""what the people want"" is not only factually false, but just plain insane. The only place where Surface has ever been popular is in the minds of PC columnists and fans with only imaginary funds to buy the products. 
Saying Surface is popular is like saying Google's Pixel 2 is popular: an easily demonstrable lie. One can be a fan of either, but you can't say everyone else is, because there aren't enough sales to matter.Surface Studio 2: a product for creative pros that's not very pro
The primary allure to Studio 2 is the way it lies not quite flat so you can draw on the screen. This could appeal to a small sector of artists who prefer to draw by hand on a computer display, but prefer to be limited to a desk. Essentially, a $2,500 Wacom Cintiq permanently attached to a $1,000 PC so you throw both out and buy a pair of new ones when you upgrade.
By entering a small market with an expensive, over-serving product that's less flexible and offers nothing really new, Microsoft has capitalized on the opposite of disruption. 
That is entirely the opposite of what Apple is doing with its iPad Pro, a product that makes hand-drawn artwork on a high-end display affordable, highly mobile, and compatible with a broad portfolio of popular touch-centric software, rather than trying to graft Apple Pencil into the existing desktop world of windows and a mouse, and requiring a complex hinge to make it possible to turn a desktop PC into a tilted drawing surface. 
Really, the meat of Microsoft's Surface show was so thin that Warren asked Microsoft's Surface chief Panos Panay what else the company might do, suggesting exciting ideas like a USB-C webcam or a modular version of the Surface Studio that would allow users to upgrade its internals. 
Panay replied, ""Probably, you look at it and you see what's the evolution and how do we make it better for our customers. Yeah, there's still so much more to do, and while I won't tell you what it is you can put stories together.""
If you wonder why Apple doesn't comment on future products, you might also wonder why Microsoft does, actively suggesting here that consumers wait for an upgradable version in the pipeline and encouraging the Verge to imagine up vaporware, which it promptly did.  
The problem is, imagined vaporware is no longer a functional way for Microsoft to compete against the better, real products of its competitors. This may have worked in the '90s, when its arrogant promises were frequently used to dampen interest in real, shipping products, but leaving the tech press to imagine how great Vista could be while Apple was delivering real updates for Macs didn't work out well. 
Imagining up a fantastic future for Zune, Windows Phone, Windows RT, and Microsoft Band didn't help Microsoft compete against iPod, iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch, either.   Higher entry price, fewer options, seldom updated: why can't Apple do this? 
Rather than chiding Microsoft for doing all the things they've badgered Apple about since the beginning of time, PC pundits have a whole new way of looking at the world once it's a place where it's Microsoft trying to make money rather than Apple. And yes, it's a lot like their reception of Google's premium-priced hardware boondoggles like the Chromebook Pixel.
Writing for the infamous ZD Net, Adrian Kingsley-Hughes coughed up a word salad on Microsoft's Surface announcement titled, ""Microsoft's new Surface PCs are the Macs I want Apple to make.""
The only way to interpret this into a coherent thought is to assume he means Apple should offer products nobody wants and then go out of business, because he has never written anything in his career to suggest otherwise. But what he says he means is that, after switching ""from PCs to Macs a few years ago as my daily workhorses"" he now wants Apple to ""learn a thing or two from what the Redmond giant is offering its users."" 
He called Apple ""old and stale"" multiple times in a single page. 
""While Apple has been neglecting its desktops and laptops to mercilessly push the iPhone, Microsoft has been busy reinventing the PC,"" he wrote. ""And the result is that Mac sales have become mediocre at best.""  Those last few words hyperlinked to an article he wrote in Q3 2014 referencing 18 percent YoY growth to 4.4 million Mac sales, a number he indeed did call ""mediocre"" at the time. But words have meanings.
Microsoft has never sold so many Surface PCs in a year, and its sales haven't really grown since it launched the Surface idea, so it's not really clear what he's trying to say in calling Apple's vastly larger Mac business ""mediocre at best."" But the words he uses are that ""Apple is in a position where it can let the Mac line go old and stale because Apple isn't a computer company anymore. It's now a company that sells the iPhone."" 
In reality, the fact is that Apple's Mac operations have generated $25.2 billion in revenues over the last four quarters. Microsoft's total Surface revenues over the same period were $4.7 billion. Of course, most of that was from sales of its hybrid tablets, more comparable to Apple's iPad business which itself generated another $19.5 billion. 
To suggest that Apple doesn't care about Macs because it has a much larger business in phones is pretty silly coming from a person who is certainly aware that Surface isn't Microsoft's profit center. 
Additionally, Microsoft is doing a lot of work to support Surface and its four lines of hardware. Yet at the volumes of units it's selling, it can't possibly be making sustainable profits. Apple's computing product lineup isn't vastly larger, but its sales are massive and global. That enables it to make far greater profits even with pricing lower than Microsoft's.Microsoft is learning from Apple, just not quickly enough to matter
It is true that Microsoft totally dropped the ball with Windows Phone and Nokia, leaving it with no meaningful remaining phone business at all. But that doesn't mean Microsoft cares more about its Surface PC hardware than Apple cares about its Macs. 
The ZDNet article immediately contradicts itself, stating that Macs are indeed critical to Apple because ""having devices that support the iPhone and iPad is still important because it keeps people in the ecosystem. If there are no new Macs, people will start to look elsewhere, and that weakens Apple's grip on users."" 
Maybe he just thinks he's the only one who thought of this, and Apple is ready to throw away the Mac even as it invests so much effort into its Continuity technology—and most recently, its efforts in macOS Mojave to make iOS UIKit apps work on the Mac. 
In fact, since Microsoft shipped Windows 10 back in 2015, it has only deployed five minor point updates to its PC users. Across that time, Apple delivered macOS El Capitan followed by six point updates, macOS Sierra followed by six point updates, macOS High Sierra with six point updates, and the most recent macOS Mojave. A reasonable person wouldn't conclude that Apple doesn't care about the Mac because its iPhone business is doing so well in parallel (and getting the same pace of iOS updates). 
One paragraph later in the piece, and the author's certainty that Apple doesn't care about Macs anymore has turned into a future possibility: ""But if Apple has dropped the ball, and can't keep the Mac offering updated, it seems that Microsoft, along with its army of OEMs, is ready to fill the void."" 
However, given that Mac sales are incrementally growing even as PC sales shrink globally, and that Apple's iPad is a central cause of PC's arrested growth, isn't it Microsoft that dropped the ball, along with its army of OEMs, and hasn't Apple already ""filled the void,"" leaving little room for premium PC makers, including Microsoft, to make any gains?Apple is trying new things, they're just successful
While Apple hasn't radically remixed its hit form factors, the company also isn't just conservatively selling slightly polished versions of yesterday's technology. Its iPads and Macs employ new innovations ranging from custom high performance SSD controllers to advanced displays with ambient-aware color management. 
Apple pulled off porting its desktop OS to mobile, lightweight ARM hardware two years before Microsoft and managed to profitably sustain its iPad business across the five years since Microsoft gave up on RT, without destroying its conventional Mac business. 
Yet outside the largely standardized form factors of mobile, laptop and desktop computing, there's something else that Apple is experimenting in that is wildly more successful than anything Microsoft has done with its Surface brand.
This performance is hidden inside Apple's Other Hardware segment, which includes HomePod, Apple TV, Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats. These specialized computers that drive personal entertainment, home audio and wearable technology have excelled in markets that other PC and mobile vendors (inclining Microsoft, Google and Samsung) have failed miserably.  
Apple's sales of Other Hardware have absolutely skyrocketed over the past four years, growing from $8.2 billion in 2014 to $14.3 billion last year. Over the last four and a half years, Apple's Other Hardware has sold $52.7 billion worth of ""less conventional computing."" That alone is three times the revenues of Microsoft's entire Surface business over the same period."
Apple Insider,Hedge fund dumps Apple shares over fears of Chinese trade war,10/05/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/05/hedge-fund-dumps-apple-shares-over-fears-of-chinese-trade-war,"Billionaire David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital has disposed of all of its shares in Apple, due to fearing the potential retaliation from China against U.S. trade tariffs affecting imports, by imposing restrictions and other measures that could affect the iPhone producer in the country. 
In a letter from the billionaire to investors seen by CNBC, Einhorn claims ""We ultimately sold because our differentiated thesis from 2011 has become consensus."" Einhorn also adds ""We are somewhat worried about Chinese retaliation against America's trade policies."" 
The Greenlight Capital fund reduced its stake in Apple by 486,000 shares, approximately 77 percent of its holdings in the company, in the second quarter. On August 31, the fund sold the remaining shares at $228 apiece, offloading around $40 million in the process. 
Greenlight first bought into Apple in May 2010, and so far its investment in the iPhone maker has earned its clients over $1 billion. 
The share selloff ultimately didn't hurt Apple that much, as it recently enjoyed its highest stock price, touching $230 during trading on Tuesday. The share price did drop slightly after the Einhorn announcement, dropping down by 2.4 percent. 
Einhorn's worry of Chinese interference in Apple's business stems from the ongoing trade war between the United States and China, with the Trump Administration hitting Chinese imports with import tariffs. In September, the U.S. applied $200 billion in new tariffs against a variety of goods from China, but so far the administration has tried to avoid placing fees on produce affecting Apple. 
Three days after the $200 billion in import tariffs were applied, China retaliated by announcing $60 billion in tariffs against U.S. goods. 
Apple CEO Tim Cook has vocally opposed the measures, calling trade ""not a zero-sum game,"" and expressing optimism that the two countries will ""sort this out and life will go on."" Apple itself has condemned the tariffs and ""other protectionist measures"" in Securities and Exchange Commission filings, warning the tariff war could materially impact the company's finances."
Apple Insider,Hands on with the Nike+ Apple Watch Series 4,10/05/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/05/hands-on-with-the-nike-apple-watch-series-4,"The Nike+ version of the latest Apple Watch launched a couple weeks behind the other models, but we now have ours to check it out and what makes it different than the standard aluminum.
Unlike the other models, where the aluminum and stainless steel come in white packaging and boxes, the Nike+ edition comes wrapped in black paper with black boxes.
Bundled with the watch is the usual 5W wall adapter and all-plastic magnetic charging puck —same as the standard aluminum version.
There are a few distinct differences between the Nike+ version and the others.
First, are two exclusive watch faces that have been updated with new colors to support Apple's latest Sports Band and Sport Loop colors. There is an analog and digital option, both of which have a non-removable Nike+ logo to jump directly into the Nike+ Run Club app.
On the rear ceramic back is an etching that designates it a special Nike+ edition of the Series 4. Plus, there are exclusive band options including a new reflective band, and styles that can come bundled.
Otherwise, the Nike+ version is the same as the others, including the cost. There are both 40mm and 44mm sizes, and GPS+Wi-Fi or cellular configurations.
If you haven't already, check out our review of the Apple Watch Series 4 to see what to expect with the Nike+ version.Where to buy
Nike is currently accepting orders for the Nike+ Series 4 devices, with delivery in an estimated two to four business days. 
Apple authorized resellers B&H Photo and Abt.com are also accepting orders for the Apple Watch Series 4 Nike+, with Abt.com currently reporting a two to four week delay. The perk is the lack of sales tax collected in most states, with B&H collecting sales tax in New York and New Jersey and Abt.com collecting sales tax in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin (see here for details)."
Apple Insider,"Firefox gets support for Google's WebP image format, leaving Apple Safari as main holdout",10/05/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/05/firefox-gets-support-for-googles-webp-image-format-leaving-apple-safari-as-main-holdout,"Mozilla this week announced that it will support Google's compressed WebP image format in Firefox, leaving Apple's Safari as the one flagship browser without any compatibility.
An exception to Firefox's newfound support is the iOS version, CNET noted. Because of Apple policies, third-party iOS browsers — even Google Chrome — must use the same underlying engine as Safari.
Mozilla's adoption follows recent news from Microsoft that it will support WebP in Edge, the browser built into Windows 10.
WebP is an offshoot of Google's older VP8 video format. It was announced in 2010 by Google as a new open standard for web-published graphics, offering smaller file sizes for equivalent quality to JPEG. Animation and metadata support was added in 2011, with transparency added in 2012.
Google claims that PNG to WebP conversions result in a 28 percent to 45 percent reduction in file size, depending on the original PNG.
Apple is typically resistant to supporting formats founded by rivals, sometimes to the detriment of the end experience. The Apple TV 4K can't play YouTube videos in 4K resolution, for example, because tvOS is missing Google's VP9 codec.
In 2016, test versions of iOS 10 and macOS Sierra briefly supported WebP, but Apple later backtracked for reasons known only to itself —but are likely related to the company's adoption of HEIF as a standard.
Presently, on the Mac, Pixelmator supports the file format without extension. Support in Photoshop can be added with a third-party extension."
Apple Insider,How to add your own Quick Actions to the new macOS Mojave Finder,10/05/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/05/how-to-add-your-own-quick-actions-to-the-new-macos-mojave-finder,"Apple's new macOS update means you can markup images, rotate photos, trim videos and more without ever opening an application. It's only going to get better, too, because you can very easily create your own Quick Actions. AppleInsider shows you how.
It's not as if it's really a pain to go open Photoshop when you want to rotate an image or, say, QuickTime Player when you want to trim the start and end of a video. And yet now that seems such a chore —because Apple's simply removed the need.
Now when you find the image or the document you want on the desktop or in a folder, you just work on it right there. Select it, then tell the Finder you want to rotate it left or right. Get the Finder to open it up into a Quick Look-like window —but one where you can annotate and draw and mark it up.
These options are called Quick Actions and while Apple has been showing them as part of the new Gallery view in the Finder, in truth they're available to you all the time. Whether you like to see icons or you prefer lists, Quick Actions are a click away.
And you can add to them. It's close to absurdly easy to add your own Quick Action, to give yourself an option to edit or manipulate any document on your Mac.
There is a reason it isn't completely easy, though: you do it using Services and this is a Mac feature that rarely gets discussed.Method and means
Normally we would say that you need to think of a job you want to do, a task you want to achieve, before you look into how it's done. That's because invariably you learn faster by having a specific goal. 
And this time we started with the fact that we often have to convert images from PNG format to JPEG.  It would be great to have that as a simple Quick Action —and now that's exactly what we've got.
However, the way that Quick Actions works is that it ties the Finder in to macOS's Services. A Service, if you've not had occasion to look before, is a function that an app can offer to any other software on the Mac. 
For instance, TextSoap is a standalone application but it offers a Service. If you're in Word, Pages or really anywhere that you can write text, you can select that text and then choose to use one of TextSoap's functions on it.
You do this by choosing the Services option which is always in the application's eponymous menu: it's in the Word menu in Word, the Pages one in Pages and so on. Choose, say, Ulysses, then Services and you get a list of all relevant services on your Mac.
The problem is that few apps make as big a deal of this as they should. You will never see any app be advertised as having a lot of Services to offer. 
Which means until you start making a Quick Action, there's no way to know what Services the apps on your Mac are offering. Even if you choose an application's menu and then Services, you'll only see ones that are relevant. So you'll only see text ones if you've got some text highlighted and you'll only get graphics tools if you've selected an image.
So this once, start making a Quick Action and that's when you'll see what the possibilities are. If you find there's nothing of any use to you, wait a while and come back: Quick Actions is surely what will finally prompt more developers to offer more Services.Get started
You create and manage Quick Actions in Automator, the free automation app included with every Mac. It's in the Applications folder and if you've ever opened it before, you're going to see a difference now.
It now includes a very prominent Quick Actions button as soon as you open it. Click on that and Automator changes to offer you a mostly blank working area and a list of options to the left that's headed with the word Library.
The blank area has a header with options and the text ""Drag actions or files here to build your workflow"".
Under the Library heading, there are sections for Calendar, Contacts, Documents, Files & Folders and many more. Click on any of them and you'll get a list of Services. Clicking on Calendar, for instance, will show you Services such as New Calendar Event, New Calendar Event and so on.
You will definitely have these because they're to do with Apple's own Calendar app. Click on Documents, though, and now you may see nothing at all.
In this example, we have Word and Excel installed on a Mac so we're seeing many, many Services from them. We've got the ability to Add Content to Word Documents, for instance, or Create New Excel Workbook.
Look through all of the categories like Documents, Files & Folders and so on. And then look at all of the Services that appear. With our desire to convert images, we looked in Photos and saw over 60 Services —including Convert into JPEG.
You'll notice that there's always a small app icon next to the Services title but if you click to select it, you'll see a bigger, clearer one at the bottom left of the Automator screen. 
This not only shows you the icon of the App that's offering this Service but also explains more about what it can do. That will include a text description that may or may not be that useful: 
After the description, though, there is more useful information about what the Service is capable of doing. This is very much like you may know from Siri Shortcuts in iOS: it says what the Service can receive and what it will give you back afterwards. 
In this case it's saying that it takes graphics files and gives you them back nicely converted into JPEG.
We have this option because we've got GraphicConverter 10 installed. That's a $39.99 application that does a huge amount with photos and images —and offers Services.
This is the only part where Quick Actions is a little frustrating. If you don't happen to have that GraphicConverter 10 app then you can't do what we have with making a Convert to JPEG Quick Action. Except you might have another app that offers the same Service.
There is simply no way to know until you look. 
If you do have it or if you find any other Service that is going to be useful to you, drag it over to the blank area. 
Automator may very well give you a notification about the Service you're using. That may appear as a pop up before it accepts the Service into the blank area.
If the Service comes from an Apple app then the notification will be a helpful suggestion. For instance, if you're going to do some changes to an image, Automator will offer to add in a step that always make a copy of the original first. 
However, most of the time you're going to be using Services provided by third party developers —simply because there are so many more of them. The first time you pick one of these, though, Automator will include the step but require you to explicitly confirm that you want to use it.
Say yes and that's it, your Quick Action is complete. 
Automator is designed to let you do huge numbers of functions in sequence but for Quick Actions, you usually just want one. If Automator's offered to make a copy of the original before you convert or alter it, then you'll have ended up with two steps but you won't need any more.
Well, you could do one action that first Converts to JPEG, then rotate the image, then resize it. You aren't limited to how much you can do in Automator but Quick Actions are meant to be, well, quick actions. So keep it to one or two steps and then save your new Quick Action.
You just need to choose Save from the File menu: you don't then have to choose where it will be saved on your Mac. It's only going to one place: the spot where all Quick Actions live.Check it out
Quit Automator and go to the Finder. Open a window and navigate to an image. Click to select it and then look at the Preview pane to the right —if it's there. If it isn't, if you're seeing only your files and maybe the navigation bar on the left, then choose View, Show Preview or press Command-Shift-P.
The preview pane opens and it will be showing you some details about the file you've selected. At the bottom of that detail pane there will be the Quick Actions buttons Rotate Left, Markup and More. 
Choose More and a small pop out menu will appear —which includes your newly created Quick Action.
It will now be there in every Finder window forever, unless you change it.Quick Actions in use
From this moment on, we can select any image in any folder and choose Convert to JPEG from our Quick Actions menu. When we do that, though, it opens the app that provides the Service: in this case GraphicConverter 10.
Fine, only some apps open with an instruction screen and we found that this can prevent the Quick Action from running. The answer is to let the app open, then look for the ""Show at launch"" option that's invariably on these starting instruction screens. Switch that off and from now on the Quick Action will work.Editing, moving and deleting
There's also a Customize option in that pop out menu. Choose that and System Preferences opens to a pane called Extensions. It will have already selected the right section for you but what you're looking for is the Finder at the bottom of the list.
With that selected, you get a list of all the Quick Actions you have installed. Each has a tick box next to it which switches them on or off.
You can also drag to re-order them —and if you do that, you can move your new Quick Action so that it's always on the preview pane. Then you won't have to select More first.
You can also right-click on any of the Quick Actions here and get the option to delete them.Quick, Quick Actions
For a few minutes reading through the available Services or commands in Automator and a few moments picking one you want, you've now added something brilliantly useful to every single Finder window you ever see.
It seemed like such a small addition to macOS Mojave but the Finder's new Quick Actions are going to be one of those features that mean you can never go back.

Apple Insider,Apple left Intel processor management and testing tools unlocked for years,10/05/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/05/apple-left-intel-processor-management-and-testing-tools-unlocked-for-years,"An exploration of an Intel chipset function known as the Management Engine revealed Apple failed to lock down an undocumented feature until the last High Sierra patch, a vulnerability that could grant a skillful attacker the ability to write data to the RAM of a Mac if left unchecked. 
The Intel Management Engine (ME) is a subsystem used to handle tasks during the booting process and in the background, and has been in use since 2008. The Register reports the investigation by security firm Positive Technologies looked into how the subsystem could be abused, as a ""side-channel threat"" to the processor. 
Researchers Maxim Goryachy and Mark Ermolov, who previously were involved in the finding of a related Intel ME firmware flaw one year ago, posted on Tuesday about their latest discovery. In this case, it was about an undocumented feature of Intel ME called Manufacturing Mode, which is meant to ease the manufacturing process for device vendors. 
""Intel ME Manufacturing Mode is intended for configuration and testing of the end platform during manufacturing, and as such should be disabled (closed) before sale and shipment to users,"" the researchers state, before noting that the mode's existence and potential risks surrounding it were not provided in Intel's publicly-available documentation. 
The software used to access Manufacturing Mode is part of the Intel ME System Tools. The application is provided to device vendors like Apple to use during the production process, but it is not available to the general public. Ermolov and Goryachy both believe Intel are putting users at risk by not providing public documentation for its technology, including attacks that could result ""in data theft, persistent irremovable rootkits, and even 'bricking' of hardware."" 
Manufacturing Mode is intended to configure platform settings via Field Programming Fuses (FPF), a form of ""one-time programmable memory,"" before shipping. Manufacturing Mode can also specify settings for Intel ME, stored in its own internal file system on Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) flash memory, in parameters called CVARs (Configurable NVARs, Named Variables.)
The process of setting FPFs is in two steps, with the first being defining the values, possible only under Manufacturing Mode and are saved to temporary memory. The second step, the committing of the FPF values to the Fuses, only occurs when Manufacturing Mode is closed, meaning they are able to be changed at a later date if the mode isn't disabled. 
For earlier chipsets used before Apollo Lake, Intel separated out the access rights for the CPU, Gigabit Ethernet, and the Management Engine. If one was compromised, the others are not necessarily affected. 
In newer chipset versions, the SPI controllers include what is known as a ""Master Grant,"" which can override any existing access rights in an SPI descriptor, across all elements. In short, if Manufacturing Mode is unlocked, it is possible for an attacker to work around any blocked access to an SPI memory region, simply by changing the configuration. 
In turn, this would allow the attacker to write their own data into the now-accessible sections. 
In their research, the analysts tested notebooks from Lenovo and Apple, and found that Manufacturing Mode was still accessible in the MacBook Pro, indicating Apple had failed to disable the feature. The Yoga and ThinkPad notebooks from Lenovo did not have any Manufacturing Mode issues. 
The researchers reported their findings of the vulnerability, identified as CVE-2018-4251, to Apple earlier this year. A patch was produced and included in the macOS High Sierra 10.13.5 update in June. 
Apple's support page describes the patch as relating to Firmware, stating ""A malicious application with root privileges may be able to modify the EFI flash memory region,"" and that ""a device configuration issue was addressed with an updated configuration."" 
To end users, there is little to do other than to keep macOS up to date, and if they had not applied the patch in question, to do so soon. 
The news of the vulnerability is the latest in a long line of Intel-related security issues that have plagued the company over the last year. In January, the Spectre and Meltdown fiasco involved security holes in the processors that granted access to protected kernel memory data, with fixes for the design flaws hampering performance for some users. 
A second wave of Spectre-style security flaws were found in May, stemming from the same design-related issues. More recently, the Foreshadow vulnerability was found to attack Secure Guard Extensions (SGX), which allowed for an attacker to read protected user data from a supposedly secure section of the chip's onboard memory."

Apple Insider,"UK's GCHQ, U.S. officials cast doubt on iCloud server spy chip report",10/05/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/05/uks-gchq-us-officials-cast-doubt-on-icloud-server-spy-chip-report,"A report claiming Apple and almost 30 other companies were targeted by Chinese spies embedding chips in hardware has faced more scrutiny over the last 24 hours, with government officials and security agencies sharing doubts over the story's accuracy. 
In the report published on Thursday, Bloomberg Businessweek alleged hardware used by a number of organizations, including Apple, Amazon, and the military, had been doctored at the point of manufacture in China. It is claimed the addition of a small chip onto each device destined for use as servers would have provided Chinese hackers unfettered access to corporate networks, allowing them to spy on and acquire sensitive internal data. 
While many of the companies involved have spoken out against the report, individuals and government agencies are also commenting on the story, with the general consensus being that it is unlikely to be true. 
A rare statement received by Reuters from the National Cyber Security Center, part of the UK's GCHQ (Government Communications Headquarters) security agency, advises ""We are aware of the media reports but at this stage have no reason to doubt the detailed assessments made by AWS (Amazon Web Services) and Apple."" 
The GCHQ arm adds ""The NCSC engages confidentially with security researchers and urges anybody with credible intelligence about these reports to contact us.""
The statement from GCHQ, the UK equivalent of the U.S. National Security Agency, is unusual as the organization typically does not tend to issue statements unless pressed. Comments from the agency do get released, but typically after heavy pressure from the media or the government, and not usually over a single report containing accusations of potential international espionage. 
A number of U.S. officials contacted by the Washington Post advised they were uncertain about how accurate the report truly is. One of the officials, speaking under the condition of anonymity, previously suggested the ""thrust of the article"" was true, but later admitted to being uncertain about that assertion. 
The comments join a chorus of statements from other organizations claiming the story is inaccurate. Shortly after its publication, Apple was among the first companies to issue a strong denial of the article. 
In a statement provided to AppleInsider on Thursday, Apple insisted it ""has never found malicious chips, 'hardware manipulations' or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any server,"" that it had never contacted the FBI or agency about such an incident, and was not aware of any FBI investigation into the matter. 
""We are deeply disappointed that in their dealings with us, Bloomberg's reporters have not been open to the possibility that they or their sources might be wrong or misinformed,"" the statement continued. ""Our best guess is that they are confusing their story with a previously-reported 2016 incident in which we discovered an infected driver on a single Super Micro server in one of our labs. That one-time event was determined to be accidental and not a targeted attack against Apple."" 
Internal sources not authorized to speak to on behalf of the company told AppleInsider the allegations were ""laughable"" and ""really, really wrong."" Apple later advised it was ""not under any kind of gag order or other confidentiality obligations"" relating to the supposed investigation.

Apple Insider,Apple running free coding sessions across European stores for EU Code Week,10/05/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/05/apple-running-free-coding-sessions-across-european-stores-for-eu-code-week,"On Friday Apple announced plans to offer some 2,000 free coding workshops across its European stores between Oct. 6 and 21, reflecting its participation in EU Code Week.
The company will offer ""at least one free session every day"" at each store. Some workshops will include ""How To: Get Started with Coding,"" ""Teacher Tuesdays: App Design & Coding Basics,"" and ""Kids Hour: Sphero Maze Challenge.""
The company has additionally developed new challenges for Swift Playgrounds, Xcode, and its App Development with Swift curriculum taught at colleges and other schools. The last now has an academic certification meant to gauge a person's skills after completion.
People looking to register for one of the workshops can browse codeweek.eu/events, or the Today at Apple listings for their local shop.
Apple management has been eager to promote coding lessons, but primarily for Swift, its self-developed language. While it does have some usage elsewhere, Swift is primarily built for macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS. The company has moved to put Swift courses in a number of schools in the U.S. and abroad."
Apple Insider,"Samsung profits driven by iPhone XS components, smartphone earnings plummeting",10/05/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/05/samsung-profits-driven-by-iphone-xs-components-smartphone-earnings-plummeting,"Samsung advises it will be reporting record operating profits in its upcoming quarterly results, but while seemingly a return to form for the South Korean giant, its earnings boost is partly due to supplying Apple OLED displays for the iPhone XS range. 
Earnings guidance from Samsung Electronics released on Friday advise the company made a consolidated operating profit of approximately 17.5 trillion won ($15.5 billion) from consolidated sales of 65 trillion won ($57.6 billion) in the third quarter, making it Samsung's highest quarterly earnings on record. A full breakdown of the results has yet to be released, but is expected by the end of October. 
Despite the lack of detail from Samsung, analysts advised CNN the year-on-year operating profit increase of approximately 20 percent is probably due to Samsung's stronger sales in its components business. SK Kim of Daiwa Capital Markets believes the high sales of memory chips, as well as higher earnings in Samsung's display business will have contributed significantly to the figure. 
As the main supplier of OLED panels to Apple for its iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, alongside LG Display, Kim suggests the high margins for the components certainly helped with revenue. Apple is thought to account for 25 to 30 percent of sales for Samsung's display business, with the unit estimated to have generated approximately 10 percent of Samsung's overall 54 trillion won ($48 billion) profit for last year. 
While memory sales are said to have helped Samsung achieve record profits over the last year, there is some concern about slowing demand for memory chips, as well as a subsequent price reduction for the components. Analysts have warned about a potential downturn for memory, but it seemingly has yet to impact Samsung's revenue streams. 
Once a major revenue source for Samsung, the company's smartphone arm is expected to report disappointing smartphone sales in the third quarter. Canalys analyst TuanAnh Nguyen suggests Samsung is suffering a ""slowdown in many markets"" for its mobile devices compared to last year, despite recently launching the flagship Galaxy Note 9. 
Over the summer, Samsung revealed a 22-percent drop in its mobile revenues, despite shipping 83 percent more smartphones in the second quarter. While Samsung shipped 71.5 million units in Q2 2018 compared to Apple's 41.3 million iPhones, Samsung reported it had earned less than half the revenue of iPhone sales during the period. 
While its smartphone business is thought to be dragging down revenue, an unexpected source has apparently helped prop up revenue. Analyst Kim believes a hot South Korean summer helped increase sales of air conditioning units from Samsung's consumer electronics division."
Apple Insider,"Apple Watch Nike+ Series 4 out now, limited supplies at retail",10/05/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/05/apple-watch-nike-series-4-out-now-limited-supplies-at-retail,"Apple has shipped the Apple Watch Nike+ Series 4, making the sportswear-branded wearable device available in stores and delivered to those who pre-ordered the timepiece, but initial signs suggest some customers may have to wait before they can buy it, due to there being limited supplies available. 
The Apple Watch Nike+ Series 4 is, like with previous models, functionally identical to the standard versions of the Apple Watch Series 4, sharing the same specifications and features. The Nike+ edition does include a few changes that makes it more useful to runners and other athletes. 
An externally-visible difference is the introduction of a Nike Sport Loop Band with reflective yarn, an addition that makes the wearer more visible to traffic at night, making evening and early-morning jogging sessions safer. Other band types, including the Platinum and Anthracite Nike Sport Band, are also available. 
Onboard, the Nike Run Club app is pre-installed along with the Nike Training Club app, offering workouts and other features conducive to running and other activities. Exclusive Nike-branded watch faces are also included as part of this particular model's features. 
The Apple Watch Nike+ Series 4 is available in GPS and Cellular models, starting from $399 for the 40mm model without cellular and rising to $529 for the 44mm variant with cellular. 
Initial checking of the online Apple Store for various models reveals that in-store pickup is largely unavailable, while shipments, at the time of writing, can take between three and four weeks to arrive. AppleInsider was advised on Thursday by some stores that only low quantities of this Apple Watch model were expected to be available on Friday.
Apple authorized resellers B&H Photo and Abt.com are also accepting backorders, with Abt.com reporting a two to four week delay. The perk is the lack of sales tax collected in most states, with B&H collecting sales tax in New York and New Jersey and Abt.com collecting sales tax in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin*.Nike itself, however, is reporting an estimated delivery date of two to four days out, making it the most viable option for the quickest delivery time.
The Apple Watch Series 4 features a new 30-percent larger edge-to-edge display, a faster processor, haptic feedback for the Digital Crown, and in the United States, the ability to take an electrocardiogram without additional hardware.

Apple Insider,"Remembering Steve Jobs, seven years after his death",10/05/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/05/remembering-steve-jobs-seven-years-after-his-death,"Seven years to the day since his death, Apple's late CEO is still venerated and missed. AppleInsider talks about what the man himself thought about living and dying.
Apple co-founder Steve Jobs died at around 3:00 p.m. Pacific Time on Wednesday October 5, 2011. He was at his Palo Alto home. The Santa Clara County Public Health Department recorded the immediate cause of death as respiratory arrest but that ""metastatic pancreas neuroendocrine tutor"" was the underlying cause.
Later that day, his wife Laureen Powell Jobs issued a statement. Steve died peacefully today surrounded by his family.
In his public life, Steve was known as a visionary; in his private life, he cherished his family. We are thankful to the many people who have shared their wishes and prayers during the last year of Steve's illness; a website will be provided for those who wish to offer tributes and memories.
We are grateful for the support and kindness of those who share our feelings for Steve. We know many of you will mourn with us, and we ask that you respect our privacy during our time of grief.
Jobs was 56 years old and had been being treated for this rare form of pancreatic cancer since he was 49. Consequently he had been conscious of his health when giving a commencement speech at Stanford University in 2005. He chose to speak about mortality.
At that point, he had already had a successful operation to remove a tumor but in 2009 he took an extended leave of absence from Apple to undergo further treatment. He had a liver transplant and at the September 2009 Apple event thanked his donor.
""I now have the liver of a mid-20s person who died in a car crash and was generous enough to donate their organs,"" said Jobs. ""I am alive because of their generosity.""
We now know that Jobs had refused Tim Cook's offer of a liver transplant but in this same speech he thanked Cook and others for how they ""rose to the occasion"".Cook would again take over while Jobs went on another medical leave of absence in January 2011.
Jobs's final public appearance was on June 7, 2011, representing Apple at a Cupertino county meeting where he spoke about plans to build Apple Park.
Just under three months later on August 24, 2011, Jobs formally stepped down as Apple CEO. On his last day he reportedly chaired a board meeting, tried to fool a pre-release version of Siri with questions, and then rode home with Apple attorney George Riley.
That evening, he told biographer Walter Isaacson that ""I've had a very lucky career, a very lucky life. I've done all that I can do.""The day he diedAppleInsider managing editor at the time was Neil Hughes. He wrote Steve Jobs's obituary for the site on that day. 
""I was at the gym, and I got a bunch of calls. The news broke late and I rushed home to cover it. For me it was a story — I wasn't really emotional at the time, I was just in work mode, covering it as it needed to be covered,"" he said. ""From a news perspective, I kind of knew it was coming, but it was still unexpected. You just assume a guy like that will live forever.""
Journalists write obituaries regularly and you don't put your personal reaction into these pieces. After the work is done, though, things are different. 
""I never realized I had a 'relationship' with Steve until later,"" Hughes said. ""There was a lawsuit that involved emails between Eddy Cue and Steve. Something about iBooks. And Steve read one of my stories and actually learned something about his own company from it. The truth is Apple always paid attention, including Steve.""
Writer Bob LeVitus, who Steve Jobs would occasionally quote on slides in keynote presentations, says now that even though his death had been expected, it was upsetting. ""I was really sad when he died. It was like the end of an era,"" he remembers.
""He was one of those once in a generation guys,"" says LeVitus. ""He was brilliant. Apple isn't going to be the same after Steve. I think Tim Cook tries really hard to keep the spirit of Apple alive and the way Steve would've wanted it. [However] as the company gets bigger and bigger it gets harder and harder to stay true to doing everything excellently.""
""I don't know what the next big thing is but I don't know that Apple will hit on it without Steve,"" continues LeVitus.  ""Maybe. There's so many smart people at Apple that I'm sure something good will come out of it but Steve was the one that said let's build an MP3 player fo real people who are not geeks. And let's build a phone that actually is smart.""Legacy
As news of Jobs's death broke, friends, colleagues and former rivals spoke about him. Microsoft founder Bill Gates said: ""The world rarely sees someone who has had the profound impact Steve has had, the effects of which will be felt for many generations to come. For those of us lucky enough to get to work with him, it's been an insanely great honor. I will miss Steve immensely.""
On October 19, 2011, Apple held a memorial service for Jobs. It was initially a private event for employees and live-streamed only to Apple Stores around the world. Around a week later, Apple released the video publicly. 
That video is no longer available on Apple's site but a memorial page is. You can read a selection of people's memories about Steve Jobs and still contribute your own.
Apple continues to maintain that page and this year as every year, Tim Cook paid tribute to Jobs on the anniversary of his death:Keep up with AppleInsider by downloading the AppleInsider app for iOS, and follow us on YouTube, Twitter @appleinsider and Facebook for live, late-breaking coverage.

Apple Insider,Apple diagnostics software blocks third-party repairs of 2018 MacBook Pro and iMac Pro,10/04/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/04/apple-diagnostics-software-blocks-third-party-repairs-of-2018-macbook-pro-and-imac-pro,"In a move that essentially puts the kibosh on third-party repairs, Apple with its latest Macs has instituted a T2 security chip-related feature that disables a host machine unless specialized diagnostics software is used when replacing hardware. 
Detailed in an Apple document circulated to Authorized Service Providers last month, the modified repair procedure requires proprietary ""system configuration"" software to be run after certain hardware components are replaced. Called Apple Service Toolkit 2, the program works in conjunction with Apple's T2 security chip, present in the 2018 MacBook Pro and iMac Pro.
The suite includes the Mac Resource Inspector and tools that examine a variety of computer systems including memory, display, power adapters and cooling system, the publication said, citing the repair document. To ensure only authorized personnel are using the toolkit, Apple requires authenticated access to its Global Service Exchange (GSX) network.
""For Macs with the Apple T2 chip, the repair process is not complete for certain parts replacements until the AST 2 System Configuration suite has been run. Failure to perform this step will result in an inoperative system and an incomplete repair,"" the internal document reads, according to Motherboard.
The software is restricted to Apple Authorized Service Providers, meaning Apple has effectively blocked third-party or at-home repairs of major components. Not all hardware modifications are pursuant to the new policy, however. 
According to the publication, repair facilities must use the software when replacing a MacBook Pro's display assembly, top case, logic board or Touch ID board. The same is required when swapping out an iMac Pro's logic board or flash storage, the latter being particularly problematic for users looking to expand onboard capacity.
Word of the new protocol is likely to renew suspicions of ""planned obsolescence"" strategies, as Apple, and only Apple, is in control of T2-bearing Macs repairs. The company can, for example, discontinue repair support eligibility for said machines when they reach end-of-life, thereby forcing customers to buy a new machine. 
Apple's policy is also sure to stoke concern with advocates of so-called ""right to repair"" legislation being readied in a number of U.S. states. The laws seek to force tech companies like Apple to provide consumers and third-party repair outlets access to repair information, diagnostic equipment and parts.
Whether Apple can retroactively revoke AST 2 policies via a firmware update is unclear, but the operating restrictions hinge on the T2. Introduced with iMac Pro, the Apple-designed silicon integrates multiple system controllers, including those governing audio and SSD drives, as well as Mac's image signal processor onto a single chip. 
As part of its mass storage management duties, the T2 encrypts and decrypts user data. Additionally, and germane to the AST 2 repair policy, the chip validates the entire boot process.
The repair document was first spotted by MacRumors. AppleInsider has confirmed the authenticity of the report."
Apple Insider,iOS 12 adoption outpacing iOS 11 roughly two weeks after launch,10/04/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/04/ios-12-adoption-outpacing-ios-11-roughly-two-weeks-after-launch,"Unofficial analytics data indicates that iPhone and iPad owners are installing iOS 12 faster than they did iOS 11, though usage is still neck-and-neck about two weeks after iOS 12's launch.
As of this writing, iOS 12 is installed on 46.95 percent of devices, according to Mixpanel tracking. About 46.15 percent of people are on iOS 11, while 6.9 percent are still using iOS 10 or earlier, presumably because their devices can't be upgraded.
In the same timespan last year, 15 days following release, iOS 11 adoption was estimated at 43.99 percent compared to iOS 10's 48.89 percent, according to Mixpanel's iOS 11 tracker. Neither of the recent launch figures compare to 2016's iOS 10 launch however, which managed a 46.67 percent adoption rate over an identical stretch.
Apple has yet to announce official iOS 12 data.
Rapid adoption is presumably being driven by iOS 12's focus on maintenance and improving performance for older hardware. Most compatible devices should actually run faster in tasks like loading apps, or accessing the camera and keyboard — a change from past iterations, which have typically created slowdowns whether small or huge.
There are a number of new features in iOS 12, such as Screen Time, Siri shortcuts, grouped notifications, and support for ARKit 2.0."
Apple Insider,Review: Rhino's ROV slider adds epic cinematic motion to your iPhone and DSLR footage,10/04/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/04/review-rhinos-rov-slider-adds-epic-cinematic-motion-to-your-iphone-and-dslr-footage,"Rhino's ROV mobile slider is an easy way to up your photography game by adding cinematic motion to videos, time lapses, or long exposure shots, and AppleInsider's got one.
Motorized sliders are often quite cost prohibitive, making them generally limited to the professional crowd, whatever that word implies anymore. ROV is a departure from that old adage and instead offers a powerful, Bluetooth app-connected, portable slider at an affordable price point.
The idea is simple —attach either your iPhone or a DSLR to ROV, set the slider to move in the direction and speed you'd like, and start recording.
This takes already great shots, and makes them more amazing. Instead of a time-lapse with the camera frozen in place, it can now pan across the subject while the shot is ongoing. Panning video shots are now silky smooth.The basics
ROV offers the slider in Everyday and Traveler sizes which have eight inches and 16 inches of travel, respectively, and then standard and pro versions of both. Going for the pro gives you a machined aluminum ball head for attaching a DSLR as well as an iPhone, a premium metal finish, and support for DSLR-connected time-lapses.
We took a look at the smaller Everyday Pro model, and tested it with our iPhone, as well as the new Nikon Z7.
The body feels solid and premium, largely made of metal. On each end are a pair of rotary legs that can lock into nearly any angle needed. These legs are crucial when outside and trying to attain stability in rugged terrain. 
We had this angled up against the side of a tree, on a rocky beach, all without sacrificing stability.
On one side of the unit is a series of LEDs representing battery life just below a rubberized power button. Pressing it for a couple seconds will cause it to flash blue, entering pairing mode. Pressing again will turn it off.
In the center of ROV is the actual slider tray that holds your iPhone or DSLR. There is a standard-sized thread to attach either the phone mount or ball head. Whichever mount is attached, it is able to fold down into a recess on the slider for travel.App connectivity
There are no actual controls on the slider itself. Instead, all the controls are in the partner application. 
We often have issues with Bluetooth-connected hardware. We've historically seen issues with pairing or connecting reliably —but not in the case of ROV. It automatically connected to our phone within seconds each time we powered it on and had the app open.
When the app is launched each time, it asks a question of whether you are shooting with an phone or a DSLR affixed to the top of the slider.
If you are shooting with your DSLR attached on the ROV Pro, then you get shown all the controls for the slider. On the other hand, if you shoot with your iPhone, you get a camera interface with full manual controls, as well as the settings for the slider.
There are three modes to choose between when you've got the iPhone attached — standard video, time-lapse, or slow motion. Each of these gives you different options as far as the slider controls. When shooting a time-lapse, you get options such as the overall time of the shot.
There are all the manual controls you need for perfecting the shot including ISO, white balance, shutter speed, and focus. As soon as you tap the record button, the slider will automatically move into position and start the animation.
Moving to the DSLR option, you have two modes to choose between. Time-lapse and straight video. You have all the same animation options that we saw before when using the camera interface on our iPhone, but without the actual camera options.
You have several different options when actually programming the slider, though none of them are complicated. There are buttons to move the slider to one end or the other, direction arrows to control which way the animation is carried out, a timer for how long the entire transition should take, then a percentage to control how fast the speed is ramped up.
If you have the pro model for your DSLR, you can attach your camera to ROV so it is able to control the shutter for time-lapses. You program long the time-lapse will be, how long the shutter should stay open, and how frequently it should snap a picture. ROV figures out the rest and brings it all together. 
If you have a high-resolution DSLR like the Nikon Z7, these images can be combined into an 8K time-lapse, which looks amazing.Portability
ROV is designed for portability. It is compact, tough, and fits easily into most camera bags. Rhino even has a specifically designed bag just for ROV to make it even easier to take with you.
We tried out several different locations with ROV and were most impressed by how quickly and easily we were able to go from in the bag, to up and shooting.
Sometimes we felt limited by the range on the Everyday slider, but that is why there is the Traveler for those more epic shots.Shooting in the real world
Versatility is key when trying to shoot out in the real world. You never know what you will be shooting on or where your camera needs to reside. We had great success keeping the ROV stable, especially with the movable legs.
The only issue we had was while shooting in taller grass. The legs weren't large enough to keep the ROV elevated enough, so blades were getting caught up in the belt. Luckily, ROV was powerful enough to power through and showed no issues dealing with it. This is obviously surmountable by a little creativity on the part of the photographer, though.
We are going to continue shooting on ROV, and plan to try getting some fantastic night time-lapses that would be otherwise much more difficult to get.
If you are shooting on your iPhone, the ROV is very affordable for this kind of gear. The degree of options between the two sizes and pro models also gives a great degree of choice and range when picking one out.Rating: 4.5 out of 5Where to buy
ROV Mobile is currently up for order over at Rhino's website, were AppleInsider readers are able to save 10-percent by using code INSIDER10. The entry-level ROV Mobile Everyday starts at $300, and goes up to $350 for the larger Traveler model. The Pro starts at $400, and goes up by $50 for the Traveler sized."
Apple Insider,Boot Camp users may want to wait to install the latest Windows 10 update,10/04/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/04/boot-camp-users-may-want-to-wait-to-install-the-latest-windows-10-update,"Users of Boot Camp may want to hold off on the October update for Windows 10, as users are reporting instances of file deletions and issues with Intel drivers, both of which are causing problems for some using Microsoft's operating system on their Mac. 
The rollout of Windows 10 1809 commenced on Tuesday, but early upgraders are already complaining about issues in the latest update, with two issues surrounding user documents and drivers. Along with users on Reddit and Microsoft's support forums, MSPowerUser reports instances where documents, music, photographs, and other files saved to the user directory before the installation had been wiped afterward. AppleInsider has witnessed the file deletion on a Boot Camp install on a 2016 MacBook Pro, on a 2017 iMac 5K, and on an install inside a Parallels virtual machine as well.
The file deletion may be related to folder association with OneDrive, Microsoft's cloud storage service. Users are suggesting that if the documents were saved in the user directory but not connected to OneDrive, the directory can be wiped. 
A second problem is that some users have problems with specific Intel audio drivers, which according to a Windows support page could result in ""excessive processor demand and reduced battery life,"" which will cause the installation of version 1809 to fail. 
Affected users will see a window titled ""What needs your attention"" before commencing the update, advising one of the drivers is installed on the system. Microsoft advises to click Back in the notification to remain on the current version, and not to click the Confirm button, as the installation would then continue, and users may ""experience compatibility issues."" 
Microsoft is also blocking devices from being offered the update until updated Intel device drivers are installed on the system's current operating system version. The company also advises against manually updating using the Update Now button or the Media Creation Tool until the drivers are available, unless checks are made beforehand to ensure the target computer will not be affected. AppleInsider can confirm audio issues in Boot Camp with the Windows 10 update on a 2018 15-inch i9 MacBook Pro, a 2016 15-inch MacBook Pro, and a 5,1 Mac Pro. Reinstalling Apple's Boot Camp drivers solved the problem on the MacBook Pros, but not the Mac Pro.
The October Update to Windows 10 introduces a refined system search tool, a new Snip and Sketch tool, battery levels for Bluetooth devices, extended text size options, a built-in clipboard manager, the Your Phone app to manage an Android smartphone and send and read text messages, a dark theme for File Explorer, and other additions."
Apple Insider,"Apple might enhance Apple Pencil, touchscreens with ultrasonic technology",10/04/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/04/apple-might-enhance-apple-pencil-touchscreens-with-ultrasonic-technology,"Apple is looking into ways to use ultrasonic-based technology to perform touch sensing, including creating new layers for touch screens and potential changes to the Apple Pencil to include ultrasonic transducers for more accurate movement detection. 
The first of two recently-published patent applications from the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the ""Composite cover material for sensitivity improvement of ultrasonic touch screens"" filing discusses how an ultrasonic layer could complement existing capacitive-based touch displays currently used in devices, such as with the iPhone and iPad, or replace it entirely. 
The concept requires the use of multiple intermediate layers on the surface of an acoustic touch screen's cover material. Acoustic touch sensing uses transducers to transmit ultrasonic waves along a surface of a device, along the layers, with sensors detecting the waves and any reflections. 
A user's finger, a stylus, or another element in contact with the layer would affect the wave, causing reflections. By examining the reflections, knowing the time-of-flight and a wave's final resting place, the position of the object and even its size could be determined using the data. 
By using multiple layers, the difference in data between layers could also reveal the amount of pressure applied, making it usable for features like 3D Touch.
The second filing, ""Ultrasonic touch detection on stylus"" follows a similar concept of using wave-based technology, but instead focuses on applying it to a stylus, like the Apple Pencil. In this case, it is less about how the stylus interacts with a touch-sensitive surface, more detecting how the stylus itself is touched by the user. 
Rows of transducers along the shaft of the stylus would be able to detect where on the stylus' surface other objects are touching it, again affecting any transmitted waves as with the display filing. While having transducers on one end would help determine where the objects touch in terms of length from the nib of the stylus, multiple rows will also reveal what parts and how much of the surface area of the stylus is in contact. 
In more practical terms, the stylus would be able to know how the user is gripping the input device, and in what area of the stylus. 
By knowing this data, applications that work with the stylus could potentially alter what happens when the user touches the stylus to the screen, or by other actions. For example, twisting the stylus and shifting the grip around could change the weight of a pen stroke in an art program, or a tap on a section of the shaft could be used as the equivalent of a software button press. 
Determining the grip of the user could also reveal if they are left or right-handed, with that information aiding in improving palm detection features when the user is writing or drawing on the screen. 
The use of ultrasonic technology for touch detection has potential, as it could easily be used alongside other technologies, including resistive and capacitive systems, but it is doubtful Apple will use it unless it has a good reason to, considering how well established the other technologies already are on the market. 
While the Touch Bar for the MacBook Pro works well, albeit in limited situations, it is unlikely that Apple will be incorporating a full touchscreen into its MacBook or iMac lines anytime soon, with or without the above described technology. In April 2017, Apple's Phil Schiller advised a touch-sensitive display ""doesn't even register on the list of things pro users are interested in talking about."" 
Some other patent filings from September suggest ways a touch-enabled MacBook could come about, describing an enclosure for an iPad that extends the tablet's utility in a notebook form while still retaining display interactivity. Apple has also considered making an enhanced keyboard and lower section for MacBooks that turns the entire area into a giant touchpad. 
As for the stylus, Apple has suggested other ways it could change how an Apple Pencil or similar device could work in the future. One patent application in February 2018 suggests how a stylus and motion or orientation sensors attached to monitors or notebooks could allow for the stylus to be applied onto any flat surface or in the air, with movements translated into inputs for applications."

Apple's new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is packing a variety of upgrades over 2017 models. Now equipped with quad-core processors, these machines don't skimp on processing power, despite the ultraportable form factor. And even though these models were just released, shoppers can take advantage of triple digit discounts on the new machines with coupon code APINSIDER. This exclusive coupon discount, which is valid at Apple authorized reseller Adorama on nearly every config, provides shoppers with an additional $25 to $150 off nearly every Mid 2018 system when stacked with instant rebates — the lowest prices available, according to our 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Price Guide.
In addition to the cash savings, Adorama will not collect sales tax on orders shipped outside New York and New Jersey, and shipping is free. Those looking to finance the systems can also take advantage of no interest financing when paid in full within 12 months with the Adorama Credit Card (a great option for those wanting lower monthly payments). Details on how to apply can be found below.
These systems are brand-new and factory sealed, exactly like you get at the Apple Store, only much cheaper. With the coupon discount and lack of sales tax collected in most states, many shoppers can save $210 to $470 compared to buying from Apple.

Apple Insider,Some 2018 MacBook Pro owners are running into errors installing macOS Mojave,10/04/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/04/some-2018-macbook-pro-owners-are-running-into-errors-installing-macos-mojave,"Some Mac owners trying to upgrade to the latest edition of macOS are encountering errors preventing them from completing the process, according to complaints on Apple's support forums.
Users are encountering messages like ""An error occurred installing macOS,"" or cryptic references to bridgeOS, the modified version of watchOS used to handle Mac subsystems like the Touch Bar. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, though some people have managed to get around the issue by resetting their Mac's system management controller, or SMC. Even then, users may encounter glitches and strange errors.
A common factor appears to be Apple's T2 chip, so far found only in the iMac Pro and 2018 MacBook Pro. This not only runs the SMC, Touch Bar, and Touch ID, but includes an image signal processor and controllers for audio and mass storage.
Some users on Apple's community-led support forums have reportedly had confirmation from Apple about the T2 causing the problems, which suggests the company could produce a software fix in the near future.
Apple has provided no guidance on the matter at all. AppleInsider has not been able to reproduce the problem locally, but did contact several service providers about the issue. 
According to the providers we contacted, users looking to upgrade to Mojave should back up data in entirety using Time Machine, then attempt to install Mojave. If the installation fails, users should boot to the restore partition, by holding down Command-R on startup.
Following the boot to the restore partition, users should format the drive using Disk Utility prior to installation, and connect to a wired network to install the Mojave system software rather than connect to Wi-Fi. Following successful installation, data can be moved to the volume using the Migration Assistant in the Utilities folder."
Apple Insider,Apple exploring use of ear detection in future over-ear headphones,10/04/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/04/apple-exploring-use-of-ear-detection-in-future-over-ear-headphones,"Apple is examining ways to improve the listening experience when using earphones, including automatically adjusting the audio based on a user's ear shape in over-ear headphones, and even automatically switching channels between the left and right ear cups if the headphones are worn the wrong way around. 
A patent application published by the United States Patent and Trademark Office on Thursday, titled ""Electronic Devices with Configurable Capacitive Proximity Sensors,"" describes how capacitive proximity sensors could be used to sense the presence of a user's ear. 
The core of the application stems from how music and other stereo audio is prepared into specific left and right channels. Headphones and earphones typically include labels to indicate which side is intended for the user's left or right ear, in order for the accessory to be worn correctly. 
If worn back-to-front, the stereo effect will be reversed from normal, which could cause problems with the user's listening. At its simplest, Apple offers the example of watching a movie while wearing headphones, with the appearance of audio playing into the user's left ear, but is shown on screen to be on the right-hand side. 
One solution involves the use of sensors that overlap the speakers in over-ear headphones, potentially including capacitive proximity sensor electrodes arranged in a ring. Included control circuitry could use the sensors to measure the ear pattern when the headphones are worn on the head, allowing it to determine if the left or right ear is present, then to allow the left or right channel audio to be played back through the speaker. 
On the face of it, such a system would effectively allow for over-ear headphones that would not require the left or right-side markings, but the patent application could be used in other ways. Since the sensor knows the pattern of the ear, it is feasible that the data could be used to enhance the audio for the listener, customizing the sound based on the ear shape and size. 
The dynamic combination of electrodes to create a large sensing area can also be reduce down to use fewer electrodes, which Apple suggests can enhance spatial resolution for ear detection. 
The system isn't only limited to headphones, as the capacitive array could be used in other ways, such as in a pillow that uses the ear shape to determine which side a person is sleeping. It could also be employed in areas where other types of sensor, such as optical or inductive proximity sensors, may trade off sensitivity or detection range in favor of resolution. 
This is far from the only headphone or audio-related patent Apple has applied for over the years. In July, it received a patent for ""Spatial headphone transparency"" that could adjust the sound from an audio source to make the user hear it as if they aren't wearing headphones at all. 
In February 2017, another patent was granted for a ""dual-mode"" headphone that could double up as a stereo loudspeaker. A November 2016 patent extended a decade-old invention covering wearable sports and health monitoring devices, with the filing including language suggesting it could be used with the company's AirPods wireless headphones. 
Reports from March claimed Apple was working on its own high-end over-the-ear headphones under its own name, instead of including it as part of the Beats brand. It was claimed Apple was intending to ship the peripherals before the end of 2018, but there has been barely any mentions of the headphones since. 
Apple also has experience in adaptive audio processing, with the HomePod capable of detecting its surroundings and optimizing its output to fill the room with sound, regardless of nearby obstacles or furnishings. Considering the detection and adaptation at work, it would be a small step rather than a giant leap to apply the same principles to worn audio devices."
Apple Insider,Hands on: Civilization VI in its entirety has made its way to the iPhone,10/04/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/04/hands-on-civilization-vi-in-its-entirety-has-made-its-way-to-the-iphone,"Civilization VI is now available not just for the iPad but for the iPhone as well. AppleInsider has spent several hours (for science) testing it out to see how it compares to its iPad and Mac counterparts.
It wasn't long ago we were declaring our love of Civilization VI on iPad, so we were thrilled to see it on the iPhone. This couldn't come at a better time with the recent release of the new iPhone XS Max, the biggest screen ever on an iPhone. We spent many, many hours toiling away on Civ VI both on the new iPhone XS Max, as well as our smaller-screened iPhone X.
Civ VI does a great job of making use of the display, regardless of which phone you're on. The turn-based menu system is easily navigated and animations feel fluid and natural.
There are user interface concessions that still need to be made for the Phone, though. For instance, some of the values on the top of the display are a bit small. On the iPad, it made a bit more sense to exit menus by tapping the screen with three fingers, but that seems slightly out of place on the iPhone.
Hands down the best aspect of the game is the fact it is a full-featured port of the title. There aren't any shortcuts or pared-down mechanics to compensate for hardware.
When we played the game on our iPad Pro, there were slowdowns late in the game as turns became more complex. The same holds true when playing on the iPhone, though they did seem to take a bit longer to process than the iPad, even on our iPhone XS Max. The A12 Bionic processor is a beast, but — especially with a larger map and many players — wait times can be a bit long by the end of the game.
For most, the longest load times will be simply at the start of the game before it begins, where you have to patiently wait a few moments for everything to get going.
It still amazes us that the entirety of Civilization VI has made its way not just to iPad, but to the iPhone. There is so much to do with hours of entertainment, without timers, premium currencies, or other nonsense getting in the way.Civilization VI is free to download, and allows you to play the first 60 turns of a game for free. A $60 in-app purchase at full price gives the user the full game, which gives you unlimited turns, custom scenarios, and multiplayer. Since we originally picked up this game a year or so ago, many expansion packs have also landed on iOS, providing additional civilizations, leaders, and maps to take the game even further.
Presently, the full game is on sale for $23.99. The other in-app purchases are expansions, and vary from $5 to $8, and are completely optional.Civilization VI requires iOS 11 and an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus, iPhone 8 or 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPhone XS or XS Max, iPad Air 2, iPad 2017, or any iPad Pro. AppleInsider recommends the most powerful hardware you can bring to bear."
Apple Insider,Adobe releases Photoshop and Premiere Elements 2019 with emphasis on automation,10/04/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/04/adobe-releases-photoshop-and-premiere-elements-2019-with-emphasis-on-automation,"Adobe on Thursday released Photoshop Elements 2019 and Premiere Elements 2019, the latest installments of the company's popular consumer-oriented photo and video editing tools. 
Along with the usual slate of new features, this year's updates focus on automating what would otherwise be complex workflows with the help of Adobe Sensei artificial intelligence. Like past Elements releases, Adobe is putting an emphasis on ease-of-use by wrapping powerful software features in an approachable user interface.  
New for 2019 is a revamped home screen that provides a quick overview of available Photoshop and Premiere Elements features. A card-based interface announces new tools like fresh Guided Edits, tutorials, project ideas, help and more. Adobe says the content is customized to a user's level of expertise. 
The home page also serves up Auto Creations, or photo and video slideshows, collages and other media generated by Adobe Sensei. Auto Creations sifts through user libraries for media from memorable events like birthdays, which is used to create composites complete with titles and special effects. Users can view and share generated creations from the home page or open them for further customization.  
Also available on the redesigned home page are quick links to other Adobe apps and recently opened or created files.
Photoshop Elements features a redesigned photo collage tool with new social media-friendly templates. New collages are generated at the click of a button, while a wide variety of photo grid layouts, background colors and individual photo frames are available as customization options. Once perfected, a collage can be shared to connected third-party platforms like Instagram and Facebook. 
Premiere Elements gets a redesigned Quick Edit mode that guides users through the process of trimming video clips or movies. A simplified Sceneline, or timeline, can also be accessed and provides thumbnail previews for easily combining photos, video, title screens, music, effects and more. 
Both Photoshop and Premiere Elements 2019 benefit from new Guided Edits. 
In Photoshop Elements, users can create multi-photo text, resizing and adjusting photos to fit into individual letters. One walkthrough offers instructions on altering an image to create the illusion that it was sketched by hand. A meme creation Guided Edit steps through the process of creating fun social media content with filters, borders, text and more, while another tutorial helps users decorate photos with text and border overlays. 
New Guided Edits in Premiere Elements 2019 include walkthroughs for a glass pane effect and Luma fade transitions.
Adobe also expanded file support for its 2019 software offerings. Photoshop Elements 2019 now supports HEIF on macOS, while Premiere Elements supports variable frame rate (VFR) import and HEIF editing on macOS and HEVC video on macOS 10.13 and above.  Photoshop Elements 2019 and Premiere Elements 2019 are available for $99.99 each for new users or $79.99 for upgraders. Both products can be purchased together as part of a $149.99 bundle, or $119.99 for existing users."
Apple Insider,Police contracted to guard Apple Stores in Sacramento following theft spree,10/04/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/04/police-contracted-to-guard-apple-stores-in-sacramento-following-theft-spree,"Apple has contracted a number of police departments in Sacramento, California to station officers at some Apple Stores, in a bid to increase security at its retail outlets following a long string of robberies by crews in the state. 
Members of the Sacramento police will be stationed at the glass doors at the front of Apple Stores as part of the heightened security measures, reports CBS Sacramento. While the report specifies it is taking place in the Sacramento region, Apple is noted to have contacted several police departments, with similar initiatives potentially taking place in other areas.
The presence is also thought to provide assurance to customers that they will be safe, in the event someone attempts to steal the high-priced merchandise. While the police officers attending stores increases safety for patrons, the measure isn't costing the taxpayer anything, as Apple is paying the officers as part of a private contracting agreement. 
Many stores based on malls already have a level of protection offered by mall security, but they are unable to perform their duties outside the mall property itself. Police officers are able to pursue further afield than mall security, with a greater chance of apprehending the thief or thieves. 
The beefed-up security follows a spate of thefts at numerous Apple Store locations across the state over the last few months. The thefts have been quite brazen at times, with videos showing teams entering the store and acquiring goods before departing, and some stores being hit multiple times in a short space of time. Multiple arrests have been made over the thefts, with charges brought against 17 individuals on September 30 for conspiracy to commit grand theft. It is estimated that the thefts have cost the stores more than $1 million in lost merchandise."
Apple Insider,Apple tops Interbrand's Best Global Brands list for sixth year running,10/04/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/04/apple-tops-interbrands-best-global-brands-list-for-sixth-year-running,"For the sixth year in a row, Apple is leading an annual brand ranking published by consulting firm Interbrand, although Amazon is nipping at the iPhone producer's heels.
Interbrand's scores are based on 10 categories, namely clarity, commitment, governance, responsiveness, relevance, engagement, differentiation, consistency, authenticity, and presence. Apple in particular is said to have been strongest in engagement, differentiation, and consistency, and seen its brand value go up 16 percent to $214.48 billion.
Google maintained control of second place, rising 10 percent to over $155.5 billion. Amazon, however, shot up 56 percent to more than $100.76 billion, putting it in third.
Amazon has ""reinvented almost every sector,"" according to Interbrand, revamping previously small or failing projects into successes such as Echo speakers and award-winning programming on Prime Video. Amazon's fashion business alone is said to be the second-biggest in the U.S.
Apple and Amazon are now competing in several segments, such as smartspeakers, tablets, TV set-tops, and on-demand music. That challenge is only set to escalate, for instance through Apple's entry into high-budget TV.
Other notable tech firms in Interbrand's top 10 are Microsoft in fourth, Samsung in sixth, and Facebook in ninth."

Apple Insider,"BBC's Charlie Sloth headed to Apple Music, following Zane Lowe's path",10/04/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/04/bbcs-charlie-sloth-headed-to-apple-music-following-zane-lowes-path,"Following an exit after a short stint as the head of a high-profile late night show, BBC presenter Charlie Sloth is reportedly headed to Apple Music and Beats 1.
While Sloth's departure after only a year was well-publicized, Music Business Worldwide has claimed that he is headed to helm a new show on Apple's Beats 1. Sloth hosted ""The 8th"" and ""The Rap Show"" for BBC radio, with appearances on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra.
Sloth's ""Fire in the Booth"" show is self-owned, and current speculation indicates that he will be hosting it on Apple Music going forward.
""Fire in the Booth"" is presently hosted on YouTube, and will reportedly remain there, paired with presentation on Apple Music.
""Ten of the best years of my life, I want to say a huge thank you to everybody who has listened to me over the years and supported me in everything I have done, I love you, and the journey continues,"" said Sloth. ""I joined the BBC as a boy and I leave as a man.""
Zane Lowe, Apple's first Beats 1 presenter, took a similar path. Lowe departed BBC Radio 1 in 2015, and is still the head of the flagship show on Apple Music. 
When Lowe arrived, he envisioned a future where Apple would host multiple streams of live shows, beyond just Beats 1. 
""All those discussions are being had right now. Until we have something —you've said it before, Apple will go and work on things, and they present it when they feel it's right,"" said Lowe, when asked about expansion. ""That's the answer. We're working on it.""Music Business Worldwide notes that Apple has poached four big names from the BBC for Apple Music. Departures include Lowe, Sloth, former head of Radio 1 George Ergatoudis, editor Ryan Newman, and ""multiple producers.""
Sloth's last show for the BBC will air on November 3."
Apple Insider,Apple denies claim China slipped spy chips into its iCloud server hardware [u],10/04/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/04/apple-denies-claims-china-attacked-icloud-server-supply-chain-to-spy-on-us,"A Bloomberg report claims Apple, Amazon, and almost 30 other companies were the subject of hacking by Chinese spies embedding chips in hardware for surveillance purposes, a story that Apple has now twice refuted as ""wrong and misinformed."" 
Reportedly, servers examined by Amazon had extra hardware embedded on the motherboard, found during a 2015 inspection of startup Elemental Technologies that Amazon was keen to acquire. Bloomberg writes the motherboards had an extra microchip about the same size as a grain of rice, that wasn't part of the original design. 
Elemental's motherboards are produced by Supermicro. Apple was once poised to order more than 30,000 servers for its iCloud data centers from Supermicro over two years.
The chips allegedly allowed attackers to access a ""stealth doorway onto any network"" where the computers were located. The attack with the single chip allegedly offered the potential for ""long-term stealth access"" that is usually expected of spy agencies. The attack is an extremely difficult as compared to software-based hacks, but could offer far greater results, if successful.
Aside from corporate espionage, the attack could also affect the U.S. military and law enforcement. Elemental's servers were used by the Department of Defense, the CIA's drone operations, on Navy warships, among other sensitive locations. Bloomberg claims senior insiders at Apple advised that it had found a number of malicious chips in Supermicro boards in May 2015, after detecting odd network activity and firmware problems. The company reportedly informed the FBI, but kept the details of what it had uncovered quiet, even internally. 
A few weeks after the discovery, Apple started to remove all Supermicro servers from its data centers, with 7,000 installed units replaced over a brief period. According to the report, Apple denies any servers were removed. Apple allegedly cut ties to the company in 2016, for ""unrelated reasons"" according to the report. 
However, Apple differs with the account as set forth by the publication.Industry response
Apple has provided the following statement to AppleInsider and several other venues.Over the course of the past year, Bloomberg has contacted us multiple times with claims, sometimes vague and sometimes elaborate, of an alleged security incident at Apple. Each time, we have conducted rigorous internal investigations based on their inquiries and each time we have found absolutely no evidence to support any of them. We have repeatedly and consistently offered factual responses, on the record, refuting virtually every aspect of Bloomberg's story relating to Apple. 
On this we can be very clear: Apple has never found malicious chips, ""hardware manipulations"" or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any server. Apple never had any contact with the FBI or any other agency about such an incident. We are not aware of any investigation by the FBI, nor are our contacts in law enforcement. 
In response to Bloomberg's latest version of the narrative, we present the following facts: Siri and Topsy never shared servers; Siri has never been deployed on servers sold to us by Super Micro; and Topsy data was limited to approximately 2,000 Super Micro servers, not 7,000. None of those servers has ever been found to hold malicious chips. 
As a matter of practice, before servers are put into production at Apple they are inspected for security vulnerabilities and we update all firmware and software with the latest protections. We did not uncover any unusual vulnerabilities in the servers we purchased from Super Micro when we updated the firmware and software according to our standard procedures. 
We are deeply disappointed that in their dealings with us, Bloomberg's reporters have not been open to the possibility that they or their sources might be wrong or misinformed. Our best guess is that they are confusing their story with a previously-reported 2016 incident in which we discovered an infected driver on a single Super Micro server in one of our labs. That one-time event was determined to be accidental and not a targeted attack against Apple. 
While there has been no claim that customer data was involved, we take these allegations seriously and we want users to know that we do everything possible to safeguard the personal information they entrust to us. We also want them to know that what Bloomberg is reporting about Apple is inaccurate. 
Apple has always believed in being transparent about the ways we handle and protect data. If there were ever such an event as Bloomberg News has claimed, we would be forthcoming about it and we would work closely with law enforcement. Apple engineers conduct regular and rigorous security screenings to ensure that our systems are safe. We know that security is an endless race and that's why we constantly fortify our systems against increasingly sophisticated hackers and cybercriminals who want to steal our data
Sources inside Apple not authorized to speak on behalf of the company that AppleInsider contacted on Thursday morning  called the allegations of a wide-spread attack on Apple by this vector as ""laughable"" and ""really, really wrong."" However, they did note that the company is constantly being probed for weaknesses by every imaginable online avenue every hour of every day.
Late on Thursday, Apple amplified its statement on the matter. The published Businessweek story also claims that Apple ""reported the incident to the FBI but kept details about what it had detected tightly held, even internally."" In November 2017, after we had first been presented with this allegation, we provided the following information to Bloomberg as part of a lengthy and detailed, on-the-record response. It first addresses their reporters' unsubstantiated claims about a supposed internal investigation:
Despite numerous discussions across multiple teams and organizations, no one at Apple has ever heard of this investigation. Businessweek has refused to provide us with any information to track down the supposed proceedings or findings. Nor have they demonstrated any understanding of the standard procedures which were supposedly circumvented. 
No one from Apple ever reached out to the FBI about anything like this, and we have never heard from the FBI about an investigation of this kind — much less tried to restrict it.
In an appearance this morning on Bloomberg Television, reporter Jordan Robertson made further claims about the supposed discovery of malicious chips, saying, ""In Apple's case, our understanding is it was a random spot check of some problematic servers that led to this detection.""
As we have previously informed Bloomberg, this is completely untrue. Apple has never found malicious chips in our servers.
Finally, in response to questions we have received from other news organizations since Businessweek published its story, we are not under any kind of gag order or other confidentiality obligations.
Amazon had a similar response. It said:There are so many inaccuracies in this article as it relates to Amazon that they're hard to count. We will name only a few of them here. First, when Amazon was considering acquiring Elemental, we did a lot of due diligence with our own security team, and also commissioned a single external security company to do a security assessment for us as well. That report did not identify any issues with modified chips or hardware. 
As is typical with most of these audits, it offered some recommended areas to remediate, and we fixed all critical issues before the acquisition closed. This was the sole external security report commissioned. Bloomberg has admittedly never seen our commissioned security report nor any other (and refused to share any details of any purported other report with us).
The article also claims that after learning of hardware modifications and malicious chips in Elemental servers, we conducted a network-wide audit of SuperMicro motherboards and discovered the malicious chips in a Beijing data center. This claim is similarly untrue. The first and most obvious reason is that we never found modified hardware or malicious chips in Elemental servers. Aside from that, we never found modified hardware or malicious chips in servers in any of our data centers. 
And, this notion that we sold off the hardware and datacenter in China to our partner Sinnet because we wanted to rid ourselves of SuperMicro servers is absurd. Sinnet had been running these data centers since we launched in China, they owned these data centers from the start, and the hardware we ""sold"" to them was a transfer-of-assets agreement mandated by new China regulations for non-Chinese cloud providers to continue to operate in China.What happened with Apple in 2015?
Supermicro Senior Vice President of Technology Tau Leng claimed in 2017 that Apple not only discontinued future business as a result of a single compromised internal development environment following a firmware update in the middle of 2016, but also returned equipment it had ordered.
At the time, Leng claimed that after he was informed of the compromised firmware, Supermicro asked for the version number that was installed. According to the executive, Apple provided an invalid number and refused to disclose any additional information to Super Micro. Leng also claimed that the bad firmware was for a networking chip used in the servers, and ""thousands of customers"" utilize the same equipment.
The firmware update that caused the compromise was performed in Apple's testing and design lab, and not on any forward-facing hardware. Sources claimed that the firmware downloaded was downloaded from Supermicro's support site, and it was still hosted there months after the event.
At the time, Apple was investing heavily into adding capacity to its Prineville, Ore. and Maiden, N.C. data centers. It had just concluded a massive expansion of the Reno iCloud facility  as well.
Supermicro reported that it had lost business from two long-term significant data center equipment customers in the tail-end of 2016, causing a drop in sales and profits year-over-year."
Apple Insider,Apple sued over AirDrop technology,10/03/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/03/apple-sued-over-airdrop-technology,"Patent troll Uniloc returned to form on Wednesday after a months-long hiatus from lobbing allegations against Apple, this time challenging the company's AirDrop file sharing technology with a 2006 Philips patent.
Filed with the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, Uniloc's latest attempt to extract damages from the tech giant leverages a single patent first filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in 2000. 
Invented by Jonathan Griffiths, U.S. Patent No. 7,136,999 for a ""Method and system for electronic device authentication"" details techniques of creating a secure environment for transferring data between two devices. In particular, the IP covers methods of providing authentication over a variety of wireless protocols including Bluetooth. 
According to the patent's first claim, an initial authentication procedure is performed over a short-range wireless link. Once authenticated, the two devices are then able to connect when out of range of the first wireless link protocol. As noted in following claims, the devices can exchange initial authentication information —  a key or password —  via an alternative communications link. 
The USPTO issued a grant for the '999 patent in 2006.  
The IP has changed hands multiple times since its filing in 2000, first from Griffiths to Philips Electronics that same year. It was assigned to patent aggregator IPG Electronics 503 Limited in 2009, then on to Pendragon Wireless in 2012 before landing in Uniloc's coffers in February 2018. Uniloc Luxembourg subsequently assigned the patent to Uniloc 2017 LLC in July. 
Uniloc's U.S. licensing entity, with the recently formed Uniloc 2017, is leveraging the patent-in-suit against Apple and AirDrop. 
Introduced alongside OS X 10.7 Lion in 2011, AirDrop is a first-party ad hoc protocol designed to simplify the process of transferring large files from one device to another. 
Initially developed to connect two Macs over Wi-Fi, the service first appeared in the OS X Finder. Running AirDrop allowed two Macs to quickly create an ad hoc connection without need for passwords or complex network configuration. Simple drag-and-drop functionality made the system a more attractive alternative to direct link, cloud storage and similar file transfer solutions in use at the time. 
Apple later extended — and modified — AirDrop to accommodate its mobile operating system with iOS 7 in 2013. Unlike legacy AirDrop technology, the revamped version employs a dual-link structure that relied on Bluetooth for discovery and token setup, and Wi-Fi for file transfers. Again, users are presented with an easy-to-use interface in Share Sheets that features automatic device discovery and tap-to-send capabilities. 
It is this second iteration of AirDrop that Uniloc is targeting in its latest lawsuit.
The non-practicing entity is alleging infringement of claims 13 and 17 of the '999 patent, which relate to establishing a secure link between two devices through exchange of authentication information over two separate communications links. Named in the suit are all devices compatible with Apple's current implementation of AirDrop, including all iPhones from iPhone 5 to iPhone XS Max, fourth- and fifth-generation iPads, all iPad mini generations, all iPad Air models, iPad Pro, MacBook, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, Mac mini, Mac Pro, the fifth-generation iPod and fourth- through sixth-generation iPod touch models.  
Uniloc in its suit seeks unspecified damages, reimbursement of legal fees and other relief deemed fit by the court. 
The AirDrop case is the latest in a string of Uniloc lawsuits targeting Apple technologies. In the middle of 2017, the non-practicing entity went on a spree, filing suit against the iPhone maker almost once a month.
Last April, Uniloc sued over Maps, Apple ID and remote software updates, while a second batch of filings homed in on AirPlay, autodialing, battery technology in May. Device wake-up, step tracking and Apple Watch were added to the growing pile last June, AirPlay and Home in July, the Apple TV Remote app in August and Apple Watch's GPS in October. 
Uniloc is one of the most active patent trolls in the U.S., leveraging reassigned patents or vaguely worded original IP against a number of tech firms including Activision Blizzard, Aspyr, Electronic Arts, McAfee, Microsoft, Rackspace, Sega, Sony, Symantec and more."
Apple Insider,Apple executives receive over $30M each in vested stock bonus,10/03/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/03/apple-executives-receive-over-30m-each-in-vested-stock-bonus,"Members of Apple's leadership team on Monday reaped a batch of vested restricted stock units worth more than $30 million, a bonus for exceeding board-mandated performance metrics.
Revealed in a series of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings made public on Wednesday, retail chief Angela Ahrendts, CFO Luca Maestri and COO Jeff Williams each saw 130,528 RSUs convert into common Apple stock. The lode was worth $30.3 million at the end of trading today. 
Apple withheld 68,530 shares from the awards to satisfy tax laws. 
The bonus, meted out on a yearly basis, is derived from a target number of RSUs scheduled to vest based on Apple's total shareholder return relative to other companies in the S&P 500. This week's award accounted for TSR performance between Sept. 27, 2015 and Sept. 29, 2017. 
As detailed in the documents, TSR is calculated based on a change in AAPL share price during the three-year period. At the start date in 2015, Apple stock was valued at $113.15, while the ending value as of Sept. 29 was calculated to be $234.62, adjusting for dividends. The figures peg Apple's TSR at 107.36 percent for the observed period. 
In comparison to other companies in the S&P 500, Apple's performance ranked 51 out of 454 firms, putting it in the 89th percentile. 
As with past awards, the bonus structure allows for between 0 and 200 percent of the target number of RSUs to vest, depending on performance. Anything above the 85th percentile satisfies requirements for a full 200 percent award."
Apple Insider,Apple doing 'outreach' to address weak LTE for some iPhone XS & XS Max owners,10/03/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/03/apple-doing-outreach-to-address-weak-lte-for-some-iphone-xs-xs-max-owners,"Apple is reaching out to some iPhone XS and XS Max owners suffering from LTE connection problems, which have been ongoing since the devices shipped in September.
Those affected by the issue have encountered weaker connections than with earlier iPhones, even devices as recent as 2017's iPhone 8 and X. The problem is inconsistent however, as some other XS owners have seen no trouble, or even improvements.
""Apple just reached out to me to see if I could answer some questions about my XS Max reception issues,"" Twitter user Devin Meredith wrote on Wednesday, adding that ""they're doing an outreach to some affected users and are asking to install a baseband logger to track my connection to the tower.""
The root of the problem is uncertain. While hardware defects are a possibility, it could also be a software glitch, whether in iOS or carrier firmware. Apple has pushed out software updates for similar issues in the past.
Sources inside Apple not authorized to speak on behalf of the company have confirmed to AppleInsider that there is a ""limited data collection effort"" in progress.
Apple is already testing iOS 12.1, which could include related fixes. If the issue is deemed serious enough however, the company could push out a smaller interim fix.
The current outreach was first highlighted by MacRumors."
Apple Insider,"Bluetooth in iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max reportedly causing audio connectivity issues",10/03/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/03/bluetooth-in-iphone-xs-iphone-xs-max-reportedly-causing-audio-connectivity-issues,"A small number of iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max owners are enduring Bluetooth connectivity issues where their iPhones fail to communicate with their car's entertainment system properly, a problem that does not yet have an Apple-supplied solution. 
Posts on the Apple support forums reveal problems with pairing Bluetooth devices to the latest generation of iPhones. According to the posts, the issues largely relate to connecting their iPhone XS or iPhone XS Max to their vehicle's infotainment unit, but it also apparently affects some other Bluetooth-equipped devices. 
The majority of cases also appear to indicate only the new models are affected by the issue, with the iPhone X, iPhone 8, and older devices apparently working normally in the situations. It is also not limited to a specific car manufacturer, as vehicles by Kia, Audi, Subaru, and Mercedes all appear in references to the head unit connectivity failures. 
Steps taken by users to fix the issue include deleting the pairing from the car stereo and the iPhone before re-pairing, but this is seemingly only a short-term solution before the connection fails. One user mentions they contacted Apple Support, who suggested to check the car had the latest firmware update for the unit, but no update was available. 
Some users believe it is a problem that could be solved via an update to iOS 12, referencing previous similar compatibility issues between iPhones and entertainment systems shortly after new iOS releases. 
In 2016, some iPhone 7 owners using iOS 10 found they couldn't use their devices with BMW's in-car system over Bluetooth, while an update in iOS 9.2 caused problems with various car audio solutions and assistive technologies that were not present in iOS 9.1. Car stereo system connectivity issues were also discovered in the update to iOS 8, in October 2014. But why?
Bluetooth is a catch-all term for a variety of different short range and secure wireless protocols all under one banner. It operates in an unlicensed band of frequencies restricted to ""Industrial, Scientific, and Medical"" equipment.
The standard protocol is governed by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), with the vast majority of its membership consisting of companies adopting the technology, with little to no say in how the specification operates. A far smaller contingent of associate members, which consists of heavy users and implementers of the standards from audio, personal device, and automotive fields, actively participate in the specification development process. 
Another tier, promoters, are some of the biggest firms in the organization, including IBM, Ericsson, Intel, Lenovo, Microsoft, Nokia, and Toshiba, with Apple added to the list in 2015. Promoters have the most say in the future of a protocol, and historically has implemented advances ahead of the rest of the membership. 
This advanced implementation can cause compatibility issues between devices, especially between those of promoters and the rest of the Bluetooth SIG membership, as changes to the protocols are not implemented by all members simultaneously. 
According to the list of errata service releases from Bluetooth SIG, there were a total of three releases between the release of the iPhone X and the iPhone XS, including changes relating to EDR Secure Simple Pairing and LE Secure Connections. While both the iPhone X and the iPhone XS are declared to support Bluetooth 5.0 according to Apple's own product pages, it is possible that the iPhone XS' Bluetooth system has been designed with these three errata changes in place. 
Compatibility is only guaranteed between a peripheral and a host device from errata to errata. So, if an iPhone is working on baseline Bluetooth 5.0 and a car stereo is working on the same specifications, they should work normally. If the stereo is on an earlier errata while the iPhone has accounted for later-released errata, there may be some issues until either the iPhone is updated to work properly with hardware that doesn't take into account newer errata releases, or the car stereo receives an update improving its own implementation. 
In this case, the use of a different level of errata could account for the iPhone XS failing to work with a specific device, while the iPhone X that doesn't include specific errata updates works fine. Pointing fingers
While most users will blame Apple for the issues with Bluetooth compatibility, as has occurred with previous Bluetooth-related issues, it is not necessarily the case in all instances. Part of the blame could easily be shared with other device producers. 
Bluetooth SIG members are expected to stay as up-to-date as possible with the protocol, publishing firmware and software changes that regularly take into account alterations to the standard. For Apple, as a promoter with vast resources, it is relatively trivial for it to make changes to how Bluetooth works in its devices and including it in a patch or a future product release. 
In the case of the last widespread issues with iOS 9.2, which included changes to Bluetooth that broke connectivity with vehicle systems, some users found that everything worked fine after unpairing and repairing connected devices. In other cases, users had to wait for a vendor-issued patch for their infotainment unit, while more simply waited for Apple to issue its own fix. 
Regardless of the root cause of the issue, affected users may wish to check with their vehicle or after-market unit vendor for any updates to their hardware, while waiting for a response to the problem from Apple."
Apple Insider,Cable & ISP groups sue to block California's net neutrality protections,10/03/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/03/cable-isp-groups-sue-to-block-californias-net-neutrality-protections,"Four industry organizations have leveled a joint lawsuit against the state of California, hoping to stop net neutrality rules that could impact how they do business.
The plaintiffs include the American Cable Association, CTIA, NCTA, and USTelecom, Reuters reported on Wednesday. Together the groups represent major corporations such as AT&T, Charter, Comcast, and Verizon.
The suit calls California's policies, scheduled to begin Jan. 1, a ""classic example of unconstitutional state regulation."" 
California only recently signed the rules into law, but was immediately met with a Justice Department lawsuit charging that internet service providers ""cannot realistically comply with one set of standards in this area for California and another for the rest of the nation — especially when internet communications frequently cross multiple jurisdictions.""
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions went a step further, calling the legislation ""an extreme and illegal state law attempting to frustrate federal policy.""
In December the Federal Communications Commission voted 3 to 2 along party lines to undo Obama-era net neutrality protections, despite public opposition and signs that many anti-neutrality comments were faked. The effort to reverse neutrality has been championed by Republican FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, along with large communications businesses.
Should they survive, California's rules will bar practices like ""fast lanes,"" selective throttling, and paid prioritization. Phone carriers will be unable to offer ""zero-rated"" services, for instance exempting platforms like Apple Music from data caps. Without neutrality however, critics of the FCC reversal argue that the result could be a restricted, even more hegemonic internet."
Apple Insider,How to leave the iOS 12 beta program now that it has been released,10/03/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/03/how-to-leave-the-ios-12-beta-program-now-that-it-has-been-released,"You only signed up for the iOS 12 beta because you couldn't wait to see the new features. It's a little tricker to get off the iOS beta than it is the macOS one, but AppleInsider shows you how to return to the regular updates.
The beta program for iOS 12 was finished the moment the software was released for iPhones and iPads back on September 17. However, if you were on that program, you still are and this week you'll have seen your iPhone or iPad press you to install the beta of iOS 12.1.
If that's what you want, then go right ahead and install it. Unless you take steps to actively leave the beta program, you're going to be on it for good. Or at least until Apple starts testing iOS 13 some time next year.
This is similar to how you may have signed up for the macOS Mojave beta in order to try the software out early. You can quit that macOS beta program quite easily but the iOS version is a little trickier.
There are three steps: stopping your phone being on the beta, getting the phone onto the shipping version of iOS 12, and then unenrolling your Apple ID from the program.Hold the phones
On your iPhone or iPad, go to Settings, General and scroll down to a option called Profile.
Right now your device says ""iOS 12 Beta Software Profile"" on that line and there's an arrow. Tap on the line to follow that arrow into the full Profile section.
It's possible to have multiple profiles on your phone but the odds are that you have just the one listed here. It will be that iOS 12 Beta one so tap on that.
Next you get a little more detail about what this profile does but you can skip reading all of that —it just tells you that it's how you get to run the beta —and instead tap on Remove Profile.
You'll be asked again if you really want to remove this profile. You do. And then you'll be asked for your passcode.
When that's done, check that you no longer have the profile listed. If this were your only one then that whole Profile section will have vanished from Badge of honor.
Restart your iPhone. Getting the shipping version
We may never have offered a simpler tip in the entire history of AppleInsiderIt's this: wait.
If you'd been doing this before the official release of iOS 12 and you wanted to go back to iOS 11 then it would be more involved. It would require you doing a complete restore of your iPhone from your iTunes backup —which of course you have ready.
As it is, though, you're not going back, you're rejoining the ceaseless forward motion of iOS updates. Whenever the next shipping, non-beta release is, your iPhone will get that and every trace of the beta program will be gone.
Or rather, it will if you also unenroll from Apple's beta.Unenroll
Go to https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/unenroll. You'll recognise most of that address from when you first signed up but now you're going to the section for getting off it again.
This page gives you options for leaving the macOS, iOS or tvOS betas. Choose iOS and then when the instructions page appears, scroll right down to the very bottom.
Under the heading, How do I leave the program?, click on Sign In.
You'll need your beta program username and password but the odds are they're the same as your general Apple ID one. Enter them and an kind of pop up message appears asking if you're sure. 
That's it, you're done. Or very nearly.Badge of honor
After you've done all of this, it's still possible that your Settings gear icon will show a red badge with the digit 1 in it. Even though that does mean you have an update, you don't. Not yet.
Whether you get this issue depends on when you unenroll and just when a new beta has been released. If you do it after a beta update that you don't install, then you'll get the red badge.
It will go away again after the next shipping version of iOS 12 comes out.
In the meantime, just confirm your sanity by going into Settings. You'll see that update badge next to the General section. Tap on that and your iPhone will start looking for an update. Unless you happen to be doing this just when the next shipping version is available, your phone will tell you that you're up to date and there's nothing more to install.
So despite that nagging badge count, you are now off the beta program.Keep up with AppleInsider by downloading the AppleInsider app for iOS, and follow us on YouTube, Twitter @appleinsider and Facebook for live, late-breaking coverage.

Apple Insider,"Apple drops BeatsX pricing, cuts several color options",10/03/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/03/apple-drops-beatsx-pricing-cuts-several-color-options,"Apple on Wednesday lowered the price of its BeatsX headphones from $149.95 to $119.95, simultaneously sacrificing multiple color options.
The headphones are now available in just two colors from Apple, silver and black. Blue, gold, space gray, and even white have been eliminated, as has the black and red ""Defiant"" option.
The reason for the changes is uncertain. The product may have had trouble competing at its previous price point, which was only about $10 cheaper than AirPods. Both accessories use Apple's W1 wireless chip, supporting easier pairing and steadier connections, but the AirPods are of course fully wireless, and offer additional perks like a charging case.
The main advantages of the BeatsX are an inline remote, and the ability to let them hang around the neck, thanks to cords as well as magnets that lock the earbuds together.
Apple may also have realized that it's being undercut by third-party retailers. B&H, for example, is selling the BeatsX for $99, and Best Buy is even cheaper at $90."
Apple Insider,Tim Cook will deliver keynote at European Union's privacy conference,10/03/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/03/tim-cook-will-deliver-keynote-at-european-unions-privacy-conference,"Apple CEO Tim Cook will be speaking at the International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners on October 24, delivering the keynote during the public 'Debating Ethics' session at the European conference. 
Announced by the European Data Protection Supervisor, Cook will be speaking in the ""Debating Ethics: Dignity and Respect in Data Driven Life"" session, which will attempt to start a conversation on the ""right and wrong"" in the development and use of technology today. 
""Tim has been a strong voice in the debate around privacy, as the leader of a company which has taken a clear privacy position, we look forward to hearing his perspective,"" states EDPS Giovanni Buttareli. ""He joins an already superb line up of keynote speakers and panelists who want to be a part of a discussion about technology serving humankind."" 
Other contributors to the conference include web inventor Tim Berners-Lee, philosopher Anita Allen, Pascale Fung, EU Commissioners for Justice and Competition, Presidents of the European Court of Justice and Human Rights, and data protection commissioners from around the world. Up to a thousand participants are expected to attend the conference, including representatives from industry, civil society, academia, and government. 
Occurring from October 24 to October 25, the conference will be held in the Hemicycle of the European Parliament, in Brussels, Belgium. Running since 1979, the conference aims for regulators on privacy, data protection, and freedom of information to discuss issues and provide recommendations to governments and international organizations. 
Cook's selection as keynote speaker is apt, considering both his and Apple's policies relating to consumer privacy and security. In interviews, Cook has repeatedly spelled out Apple's position that the company minimizes any collection of identifiable data, often proclaiming ""You are not our product"" in comparing Apple to how other tech giants treat user data. 
On September 26, Apple VP of software technology Guy ""Bud"" Tribble informed a Senate Committee Apple was in favor of privacy legislation, conveying ""Apple's support for comprehensive federal privacy legislation that reflects Apple's longheld view that privacy is a fundamental human right."" 
""Ultimately, privacy is about living in a world where you can trust that your decisions about how your personal information is shared and used are being respected,"" noted Tribble, continuing ""We believe that privacy is a fundamental human right, which should be supported by both social norms and the law."""
Apple Insider,"Apple now blocks iOS app backups, but you can do something about it",10/03/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/03/apple-now-blocks-ios-app-backups-but-you-can-do-something-about-it,"If it hasn't happened to you already, then some day you're going to lose an iOS app that's been taken off the app store, and Apple's choices along the way may stop you from getting it back. Maybe we'll someday have to learn to live with it but for now, AppleInsider shows what you can do.
Try looking on the bright side for a moment. For years everyone has been telling you to back up your iPhone to your Mac and you've never bothered. Now you don't have to —but that's because as of macOS Mojave, there's just no point. 
It's true that plugging our phones into iTunes has been inconvenient. So let's take a moment to applaud how Apple has made iCloud backups better over the years.
And now rage about how what's really happened is that the iTunes backup has been reduced. There is no longer any discernible difference between the two and that's because Apple has removed the single greatest reason to back up to your Mac.
Previously you were able to make backups of your iOS apps: plug your phone into iTunes on your Mac and it backed up your apps. 
It also let you pick one of those apps and drag files to it via your Mac. We don't miss that because it was slow and fiddly, at least compared to the ease we now have of doing the same thing automatically with iCloud Drive. Still, we used it and it was sometimes the handiest solution.
It's the backups we miss. The backups. Say you delete an app and then change your mind. Or perhaps you have to dump a pile of apps to get enough room on your iPhone to install an iOS update. Once an app is off your iPhone, you are risking never being able to get it back.
Now, granted, that's a worst case but we'd rather be pessimistic than take Apple's optimistic view. The company believes that you can delete your apps and always be able to restore them simply by re-downloading what you need from the App Store.
You can see their logic. Any of us can search the App Store and when we find an app we've previously bought, it's shown to us with an iCloud download icon instead of the price or a Get button. Click on that and the app redownloads.
Don't be on the road, though. The App Store will not let you download anything bigger than 150MB over cellular, regardless of how good your plan is. 
Whereas before, if you backed up to iTunes on a MacBook, you could have that with you on the road and just restore the app directly from there to your iPhone.
Still, most people do either go to the App Store or maybe schlep though their previous purchase list. To get that you just have to open the App Store app on your phone, tap Updates, then tap on your profile photo, next tap on Purchased, then My Purchases, wait for the long list to load and then finally search for the app.
You can mock the number of steps you have to go to if what you want is to scroll through your previous purchases to find an app whose name you've forgotten. However, the facility is there and every app is available to you immediately —except it isn't and never has been.Lost apps
Apple removes apps from the App Store. Permanently. We wouldn't dream of complaining when those apps are discovered to be stealing our data as naturally any kind of malicious app needs to be removed. Come on, we're not Android users.
Sometimes the decision is more controversial, such as last month when Apple dropped Alex Jones's Infowars app as well as the commentator's podcasts from iTunes. 
Surprisingly often, there's nothing wrong with the app and they haven't transgressed Apple's rules —but they have contravened local regulations. Such as when in August 2018, Apple removed thousands of gambling apps in the China version of the App Store. Or a year before when Apple removed VPN apps from the same store.
Or one more example: Apple removed messaging app Telegram after pressure from the Russian government —but then restored it.
Ultimately Apple has control over what is in its App Store and generally we're fine with that because it's part of the whole process that means we get far fewer problematic apps than are in the Google Play store. We can imagine losing an app this way that we'd rather keep but there's more of an issue with who has, well, penultimate control.
Developers can remove their own apps at any point by changing the rights and territories details in their iTunes Connect account.
Usually that means they remove it from sale and the app remains available for download by anyone who's purchased it. However, that's never been guaranteed: we had an app we only installed every time a client needed us to and one day we couldn't get it back.
It was a terrible app and we didn't miss it but we learned that day to trust our iTunes Mac backups instead of the App Store.
That was one app for one AppleInsider staffer in the years since the App Store opened and your heart is bleeding for us. Only, if we're aware of it happening to us just once, still it happens often enough to people that up until this month, Apple has provided a solution.
While it didn't promote this, if you needed to backup or manage apps on your Mac then you could download a special version of iTunes. Shortly after the rest of us got version 12.7, you could elect to instead download iTunes 12.6.3. It was made to help business customers who might be managing multiple devices and apps for many staff but it worked for individual consumers just as well. 
Even though it had an earlier version number than 12.7, Apple made your Mac regard 12.6.3 as the newer one so that it would install. It was also updated: it wasn't the same iTunes as previously released, it now supported then then-new iOS 11. 
Don't get excited by Apple's support page about how to use this special version of iTunes. While the Windows edition is still available from that page, Apple originally removed the Mac one last month and then returned it on October 2 —without adding Mojave support.
Right from when Apple first released this legacy iTunes edition to help customers, the company has stressed that it does not support it. Now even though it has just updated this version to 12.6.5, it states that this is not compatible with macOS Mojave.
Mind you, Apple hasn't bothered to update the app's release notes to say that —the Read Me still says macOS 10.10.5 or higher.
So whether you get it now or you already downloaded it, this version of iTunes is no use to you. It's not that it's a little incompatible, it isn't that there are some bugs, it's that it won't even launch under the new macOS.
Apple says you don't need it. You can use an app called Apple Configurator 2 for Mac instead.Give us strength
This free Configurator app is aimed at corporate IT users who have to prepare, install and maintain anywhere up to thousands upon thousands of iOS devices. Fortunately, it also works with one.
Unfortunately, it only works very, very badly. It is confusing and also somehow inconsistent in what it achieves.
If you launch it and plug in your iPhone, you can restore apps to your iOS device fro your Mac. By default it expects you to be getting them from your previous purchase history on the App Store. If that's right then it re-downloads them for you before going on to install them directly onto your device.
However, you can also elect to restore apps stored on your Mac. Click on Choose from my Mac and navigate to the right folder. Your apps are stored in /Music/iTunes/Mobile Applications and they are the app name with an extension of .ipa.
You're faster off going to that folder in the Finder to see if an app is there: Apple Configurator 2 is that slow. It will also sometimes just display a blank icon and the name Placeholder instead of the app's actual title. If you get a lot of those then there's no way to know which is the one you want.
However, if you get just one Placeholder then it is your correct search result and you can install it.
The single most useful thing Apple Configurator 2 did for us was to show how incredibly often apps have been removed. We have some 900 old apps stored in Mobile Applications and over and over we'd learn that app was gone from the store.
That doesn't matter, though, because we've got them and we can install directly from Apple Configurator 2 to our iOS device.Or so you'd think
Pick an app and Apple Configurator 2 will install it to your iOS device. You can see it. It's there. Except sometimes the icon will be slightly dim and nothing happens when you tap on it. Other times the same app will launch when you tap on it, but you get an error message saying the developer must update it to work with iOS 12.
Then sometimes the app will open just fine —for now. Go back to your iPhone after a few minutes and an app that Apple Configurator 2 finished downloading will have its status changed to Downloading or Waiting. 
Later, it will change back again. Without you or Apple Configurator 2 having done anything.
You thought iTunes was bloated but at least it worked. And what's more, it did one further thing that neither Apple Configurator 2 nor any other Apple app can do.Save new apps
Next time you buy an app from the App Store, you have no Apple-provided way to save it to your Mac. You can't back it up to that Mobile Applications folder, you can't physically copy it anywhere.
Apple Configurator 2 will backup your iOS device —but it ignores the apps.
There is a solution: third-party app iMazing will let you manage your new and old apps on your Mac. We looked at a version almost a year ago, and we'll be doing so again shortly.
It's intended for managing backups of music, photos and more but the app handling is the reason to buy it. For an individual user, iMazing costs $44.99 to use on one computer. It's also available on Setapp.
With Apple first shutting off apps in iTunes 12.7, then giving but taking away again the legacy iTunes 12.6.5, you have to wonder what's next. It doesn't seem possible that Apple will take any further steps to remove the ability for software to handle apps, however. 
For developers must be able to create .ipa files before uploading them to the App Store. And while apps are .ipa files, those files must be copied and stored and managed somehow.About that iTunes backup
There were other differences between backing up to iCloud and backing up to iTunes. 
Apple maintains a support page on these differences but grows progressively shorter by the month. Today it more lists what they each don't do.
So right now neither iTunes backup nor iCloud ones will copy anything from iTunes, App or Apple Books Stores. Neither of them will copy Touch ID, Face ID or Apple Pay information. 
Still, iCloud also won't backup Messages, Contacts, Calendars, Notes, iCloud Photos or text messages. That information is already on your Mac via iCloud but Apple's page says it's backed up and we're not clear whether this is semantics or a separate backup. Either way, so long as you get to save your data, we're happy.
We'd like app control and backup returned to us in some way but we'd also like to see some consistency. Right now iCloud backups are automatically encrypted and iTunes ones are not. You have to positively choose to make an iTunes backup be encrypted and that only takes a single click in a tick box.
However, unless you know to do that, your backups are not encrypted —and that has an extra impact. Unencrypted iTunes backups will not contain the activity, health or keychain data from your iOS device until you switch on encryption.
So until you know that, your iCloud backup is actually better than the iTunes one. 
We've come a long way from when we used to all plug our phones into our Macs every day. And if it's genuine progress, it's not all genuine progress.Keep up with AppleInsider by downloading the AppleInsider app for iOS, and follow us on YouTube, Twitter @appleinsider and Facebook for live, late-breaking coverage.

Apple Insider,Why Samsung's smartphones are winning in shipments but losing in business,10/03/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/03/why-samsungs-smartphones-are-winning-in-shipments-but-losing-in-business,"This summer, Samsung Electronics reported a 22 percent drop in mobile revenues and a 34 percent collapse in year-on-year profits in its IM division, which includes smartphones, tablets, PCs, watches, and other products comparable to Apple's business. Over the same three months, Apple reported a greater than 17 percent increase in both its revenues and profits. Why is the world's largest phone maker by unit volume performing so poorly?Samsung ships 73 percent more phones, makes much less money
The issue is not just a deceptive portrayal of percentages of growth. Samsung's calendar Q2 mobile revenues from its IM segment were reported to be 22.67 Trillion KRW ($20 billion). Apple's net sales for the same quarter were more than double that: $53.265 billion. 
Apple's sales are growing significantly despite having revenues twice as large as Samsung IM mobile, even as Samsung's mobile sales are rapidly dropping to unit levels last seen five years ago. 
Samsung's IM operating profits includes its mobile business comparable to Apple, plus its commercial networking equipment business all amounting to 2.67 Trillion KRW ($2.4 billion), while Apple's operating income for the same period was $12.612 billion. While chalking up twice the revenues, Apple's operating profits were over five times larger than Samsung IM.
The majority of the revenues and profits of both entities come from sales of smartphones. In the second calendar quarter, Samsung shipped 71.5 million units. Apple shipped 41.3 million iPhones, just under 60 percent of Samsung's Q2 volumes. How is Apple making so much more money, despite selling fewer phones? Premium iPhones in demand 
In part, it's because Apple has successfully concentrated on the valuable segment of the market. That isn't to say Samsung hasn't tried to reach affluent buyers with more expensive phones; it has just failed to do so at Apple's level. 
A cynical pundit might imagine that Apple's more profitable iPhone sales could be explained away by incessant, clever marketing that fools people into not buying less expensive Androids. 
However, the reality is that it was Samsung that spent lavishly on advertising, marketing, and celebrity endorsements until it became infeasible to continue laying out $14 billion annually to promote the Galaxy brand. 
That was what Samsung was spending in 2013 as it approached the peak of Galaxy sales, while Apple spent about $1 billion on advertising and relying largely on brand loyalty to maintain sales. 
Five years later, Samsung's second quarter phone sales are at their lowest point since the beginning of 2013, or about 6 million fewer than it sold in Q2 five years ago. Apple's most recent Q2 iPhone sales were over 10 million higher than its Q2 sales from 2013.
Note that five years ago was not only peak Galaxy, but also the pinnacle of analyst fretting over the idea that Apple had ""lost its ability to innovate"" while demanding that the company produce low-end iPhones priced around $300.
Grilled about this in a conference call, Apple's chief executive Tim Cook stated at the time, ""our growth will come from new services and products,"" adding, ""I don't subscribe to [the notion that the] higher end of the smartphone market has hit its peak.""Samsung invented expensive smartphones, it just can't sell them
Across the second half of the iPhone decade since Cook made his comments about higher-end smartphones, Apple's Average Selling Prices have risen dramatically —particularly with the introduction of new larger Plus models and the most recent luxury-class iPhone X models. 
However, it was Samsung that first pushed up prices of its most expensive Galaxy S and Note lines higher than Apple's standard iPhone price-point. While it wasn't the first to introduce big ""phablet"" handsets, Samsung is often credited with popularizing the big phone, and it gave the phablet a new, higher price tier.  
While nobody seemed to notice back when Samsung was working to boost the prices of premium phones, once Apple's ultra premium iPhone X raised the price of luxury phones to $999 and up, the media put on a show of shock and outrage, apparently without ever realizing that $999 phones existed before iPhone (even before considering inflation).French so shocked by iPhone X price they make it most popular phone by revenue
In France, Le Parisien gasped last fall that the new iPhone X was priced the same as the SMIC, the French minimum allowable monthly wage —at least once French taxes and the dollar exchange rate brought iPhone X to 1,159 Euros. How could the lowest paid workers in the country ever afford the most expensive luxury phone on the market? 
It appears that at least some of them found a solution. A few might have flown to New York to buy an iPhone X at a significant discount, but just looking at sales within France, iPhone X was Apple's most popular model this summer —well after its initial launch last winter —according to July data by Counterpoint. Sales were ahead of the less expensive iPhone 8 and all of Apple's other more affordable offerings. 
There were three other smartphone models that were ahead of iPhone X in French sales by units: two Samsung Galaxy J-series phones from 2017, and Huawei P20, a Chinese phone designed to look as close to a iPhone X as possible. 
But while Samsung was hailed as the leader du marche des smartphones (leader of the smartphone market) by Statistica ""data journalist"" Claire Jenik for having sold so many Galaxy J models, she neglected to note that the Galaxy J sells for less than 200 Euros, currently priced at 124 Euros on Amazon.fr. The Huawei P20 starts at 250 Euros. In July, the iPhone X was sold for 1160 Euros and iPhone 8 was 810 Euros. 
Noting that detail changes the picture dramatically. Among the top five French models, Samsung's 6 and 7 percent market share of ~200 Euro Galaxy J models obviously resulted in far less revenue than Apple's 4 percent of French sales captured by its highest-end phone priced at least 6 times higher. In fact, Samsung's Galaxy J units were outperformed on a revenue basis by iPhone 8, with a price roughly four times higher. 
It's not exactly a secret that Apple's revenues and profits are crushing Samsung and every other mobile and PC maker, but it is something that marketing data groups and ""data journalists"" appear to work very hard to obscure—either for dramatic purposes, to maliciously misinform, or just because they are simpletons who think nickels are bigger than dimes.Apple and the price premium  
Despite the media puffery that the prices of Apple's least affordable products are ""too high,"" note that Samsung was also selling its Galaxy S9 in France for 860 Euros, with models priced as high as 1,060 Euros, with the the Galaxy Note 9 as high as 1,260 Euros. 
Samsung simply wasn't selling enough of those pricey models in France to enter the top five. 
In fact, the S9 turned in disappointing sales globally. That's not just some analyst conjecture cited by Business Insider clickbait. Samsung itself noted to investors this summer that despite the fact that ""demand for smartphones and tablets grew slightly QoQ,"" the reason for its 34 percent drop in IM results was that ""earnings decreased due to increased marketing expenses amid declining revenue attributable to lower-than-expected sales of the Galaxy S9.""
So one reason why Samsung is performing so poorly compared to Apple is that its fanciest phones are not appealing to buyers, while the high volume phones that it is shipping have to be priced so low that they can't contribute toward profitability. 
Note that while Samsung's phone shipments are indeed down in the most recent reported Q2 (having fallen by about 10 percent YoY) its profits were down by over three times that much. That makes it clear that each percentage point of market share is not equal in value. 
It's no secret that phone profits come from the top layer of cream. For Samsung, the cream collected from its Galaxy S and Note sales is thin —and is subject to wild swings based on whether it can drum up interest for new models or avoid major bungles like the Note 7 disaster. 
For Apple, the iPhone is all cream. There are no Apple phones that sell for $125 new from the factory, let alone in large volumes that make up most of its sales. That kind of low-end whey byproduct simply doesn't exist for Apple, and therefore can't compete with Apple's featured selection of premium models. 
In France, as in other markets, many buyers are opting for cheap smartphones, but overall, the votes by dollar are being awarded to Apple.The Apple ecosystem
Samsung's inability to successfully build high-end phones that attract attention is not the only reason why the largest Android licensee is failing. 
The Samsung IM mobile group also builds Windows PCs, Galaxy Book Windows tablets, Chromebooks, Android tablets (including new tablets running Android KitKat from 2013!), Tizen smartwatches, fitness bands, wireless headphones, VR cameras and headgear, wireless chargers, and a variety of ""smart home"" hubs, sensors, and outlets.
Yet, all of these products are collectively worth nearly nothing. Samsung's revenues and profits are tied almost exclusively to its smartphone sales, while all of these other products are merely placeholders seeking to find a new market—so far, very unsuccessfully.
In fact, across ten years of increasingly competing with Apple since iPhone appeared and radically disrupted the phone market, Samsung has never broken out any significantly new, commercially successful product from its IM group. 
Contrast that with Apple. Across same period of time, Apple's Mac business roughly doubled in size. Apple introduced iPad as an entirely new platform, currently shipping 11.5 million units in the last quarter. Both businesses each generate revenues of about $5 billion per quarter, totaling half of what Samsung's entire IM mobile unit does. 
Samsung's vast array of Windows, Android, and Chrome computing devices are not any meaningful percentage of its IM mobile unit sales or profits. 
Beyond conventional computing devices, Apple also has an Other Products category that reported sales of $3.7 billion in the last quarter. That includes iPod, Apple TV, Apple Watch, AirPods, HomePod, and other accessories. Samsung makes many of the same devices, but none of them contribute enough to break out as their own category, and Samsung never even makes mention of these to its investors when talking about profits, because they don't meaningfully contribute to Samsung's business. 
Apple also has another business segment: Services, which includes the App Store, iTunes, AppleCare, Apple Pay and other services. Samsung has made stabs at attracting developer interest in proprietary apps for Galaxy devices, tried to launch its own Milk music service, invested a quarter of a billion dollars to launch Samsung Pay, and even worked to deploy Tizen as an apps platform. 
Yet, there's no visible contribution from any of these attempts. At the same time, Apple's Services has generated $9.5 billion in its seasonally slower summer quarter —again, nearly half of Samsung IM mobile's entire quarterly revenues.Five years of unappreciated Services
Note that analysts seem to just now be catching on to the idea of Services. But five years ago, Apple's ""iTunes, Software and Services"" segment was reporting $3.99 billion in quarterly revenues, greater than the combined revenues of HTC and Motorola —which was then owned by Google. 
Rather than drawing attention to Apple's Services, everyone from the Wall Street Journal to Wired spent the year writing excitedly about the wonderful prospects ahead of Google's Motorola acquisition. Lest anyone think it was just $13 billion spent on patents, Steven Levy documented the fact that ""the Moto X is the first in a series of hardware products that Google hopes will supercharge the mother company's software and services.""
Instead, Motorola burned through $704 million within just six months, before Google could sell it off for scrap. And while Apple's quarterly Services revenues have since more than doubled to $9.5 billion in Q2, Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai was able to excite analysts this year with the news that Google Cloud services (including its G Suite productivity tools such as Google Docs, Google Sheets and Gmail) were ""already"" $1 billion per quarter. Meanwhile, Google Play continues to service twice the downloads while earning half the revenues of the App Store.
If all of this buildup and hype culminated in just a $1 billion quarter for Google Cloud five years later, imagine how negligible Samsung's services revenues are, given that it has no real cloud, software, or music sales at all.Samsung's decade of failure
In retrospect, Samsung's efforts to replicate Apple—including those years when it was slavishly copying iPhone and iPad—have ended up an exceptional failure. Not only has it failed to build a similarly profitable phone business (and recall that Samsung is no scrappy smartphone underdog, but was instead a leading Symbian/Windows Phone handset maker back when the iPhone hit), but it has gone nowhere in its strategically scattershot attempts to instantiate the computing goals of Microsoft or Google, or even to build its own platforms from scratch. 
That's true even in areas where Samsung enjoyed a first mover advantage —such as with smartwatches —where it seemingly could have established a business in the years where it had no competition from Apple at all. Samsung also went all in on VR with no competition from Apple, but couldn't turn it into a real business, in part because the ""trailblazing""  Note 7 literally burned it down.
Samsung's IM group also had a clear advantage in being closely associated with the company's other semiconductor component and display groups, which have been building state-of-the-art display panels, memory, and processors since before the launch of iPhone. Yet even at points where it could take advantage of new, internal technologies such as larger panels or OLED screens, Samsung's IM mobile group has snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.  
Within a couple years of Samsung gaining some traction for its larger phones, Apple introduced its own larger iPhones and crushed sales of high-end Samsungs. Outside of Samsung IM, the company has segments performing well in components, and is currently the exclusive supplier of OLED screens for Apple's high-end iPhones. However, Samsung's sketchy business practices resulted it it losing Apple's business as a chip fab, and it appears to also have been Qualcommed by Apple in DRAM and NAND memory.Bloomberg reported this spring that Samsung's OLED panel business was experiencing negative growth, and incorrectly jumped to blame this on Apple's iPhone X, which it assumed must not be selling well. Samsung's Mobile IM has shifted from a shining Galaxy star to an embarrassing black hole of a liability for the entire conglomerate
The reality was the Apple's flagship was selling incredibly well. It was Samsung's Galaxy S9 that was not selling well. So poorly, in fact, that Samsung Electronics' Display Panel unit turned in lackluster results despite having the coveted role of being the sole OLED supplier of the world's most popular smartphone, iPhone X. 
Samsung's Mobile IM has shifted from a shining Galaxy star to an embarrassing black hole of a liability for the entire conglomerate.       The lethal savior of Android
Android was supposed to be an open technology that would unlock markets and increase innovation. For Samsung, the world's largest Android licensee, it has instead ended up being more of a noose, resulting in the loss of critical business from its largest partner while doing virtually nothing to support replacement businesses from tablets to music players to netbooks and the other devices it was hailed to facilitate.  
Outside of Samsung, the new hero of Android is supposed to be firms in China. However, the profitability of the top Chinese brands (Huawei, OPO, Vivo, and Xiaomi) in the same Q2 was collectively reported to be about $2 billion, or about the same as Samsung's for the same quarter, according to data from Counterpoint Research. 
Those figures are all limited to the smartphone market. Counterpoint's data unbelievably suggests that Apple only made about $6 billion from iPhones in that quarter—less than half of the $12.6 billion in operating profits it reported. But when you consider that Chinese production of smartphones is still scraping the barrel in profits, it's pretty clear that these Chinese brands aren't somehow making tons of money selling PCs, netbooks, tablets, watches, headphones, VR gear and so on, any more than Samsung is.
At the recent ten year anniversary of Android, various fans of the platform wrote platitudes about how Android has been so incredibly successful and deserves our eternal admiration. In comparison to Apple, that's simply not true. 
Android did help prevent any alternative competition from successfully growing—it leached critical attention away from Windows Phone, from Bada and Tizen, and from other mobile Linux distributions. But it hasn't returned its licensees to anything resembling a pre-iPhone world.
In fact, the reality is that Google's mismanagement of Android, which I first outlined in detail nine years ago, limited it to being a hobbyist platform that's served largely a training wheels for Apple's iOS, a technological onramp for basic smartphone users to eventually trade up to a premium mobile experience. And as I wrote five years ago, the Google's implementation of the openness of Android has been a liability, not a secret weapon.  
Samsung, LG, Sony, Motorola, HTC, Blackberry, and other firms that were successfully building phones based on licensing Java on Linux before Google rebranded it at Android were not returned to industry leadership in profitability by the ostensibly open new version platform just because Google prevented Sun from licensing its own technology. Most of those companies have been effectively obliterated —if not directly by Google and Android, at least certainly not sustained by Android in a meaningful way. 
If you imagine that Samsung is better off being aligned with Android than having gone solo, you should look into how hard the company has worked to desperately free itself of Android on phones, watches and TVs, and how little attention it gives Android in its marketing, while focusing on its own brands and proprietary technologies that it does not share with other Android licensees.
Nokia, the largest phone maker to resist joining Android, was independently tanked by Microsoft—suggesting that it wasn't solely Android wiping out mobile industry incumbents. In fact, given that every phone platform has struggled to survive (or to successfully branch into new categories including tablets and wearables), it's hard to avoid saying that all of this destruction was largely the result of Apple's competence in building attractive products."
Apple Insider,"iTunes that can manage apps updated, but incompatible with macOS Mojave",10/03/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/03/itunes-that-can-manage-apps-updated-but-incompatible-with-macos-mojave,"Apple has updated a new forked version of iTunes for organizations that still need desktop-based app installation, but adoption may be limited, since the software doesn't work with macOS Mojave.
Links to iTunes 12.6.4.3 have been added to an Apple support document focused on how to deploy apps via iTunes instead of using Configurator and the Volume Purchase Program. Versions are available for the Mac, and 32- and 64-bit versions of Windows.
Apple warns that users —mostly enterprise customers —who download this edition of iTunes will have to update manually, and won't get technical support. The company also specifically notes that this update is incompatible with the new operating system, casting some doubt that it will ever be updated for macOS Mojave.
The App Store has been absent from the mainstream edition of iTunes since version 12.7 in September 2017, requiring most users to find and download apps directly from their iPhone or iPad. Apple's enterprise tools make it possible to push apps without iTunes, but some organizations may want to distribute apps offline for security or privacy reasons.
Installing iTunes 12.6.4.3 will over-write later releases, such as the aforementioned iTunes 12.7, all the way through the current version."
Apple Insider,iPhone XS Max scores second in DxOMark's smartphone camera tests,10/03/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/03/iphone-xs-max-scores-second-in-dxomarks-smartphone-camera-tests,"In a review published on Wednesday, benchmarking firm DxOMark scored the rear camera on the iPhone XS Max 105, ranking it second only to the Huawei P20 Pro, and comfortably above the Google Pixel 2 and Samsung Galaxy Note 9.
The phone has ""one of the best mobile cameras,"" with significant improvements over the camera in the iPhone X, the company wrote. That includes Smart HDR, which is said to produce ""very good target exposure and a wide dynamic range in all conditions."" In bright lighting the XS Max is noted to have ""excellent"" results in both photo and video, with ""spot on"" exposure in outdoor shooting as well as good detail and color. 
The phone actually scored 110 in photo and 96 in video — the biggest weakpoints in photo being zoom and bokeh (depth-of-field), the latter because Apple's simulated bokeh still makes mistakes in calculating depth, even if the XS Max does a better job than its predecessor. 
DxO also took Apple to task for problems like underexposed flash shots, and luminance noise in zooms, shadows, and low light.
Video problems included the above-mentioned luminance noise as well as ""unstable"" white balance with indoor lighting.
The XS Max scored above several prominent competitors, such as the Google Pixel 2, and Samsung's Galaxy Note 9 and Galaxy S9 Plus. The P20 Pro ranked first as a ""triple-camera juggernaut,"" DxO said.
For several years now Apple has regularly promoted its cameras as one of the main selling points of iPhones. The rear camera on the XS Max has ""focus pixels,"" upgraded light sensitivity, and enhanced processing thanks to a custom image signal processor and the A12 Bionic chip's Neural Engine. In a first for Apple, bokeh can be adjusted even after a photo is taken."
Apple Insider,Video smackdown: Comparing the iPhone XS Max versus the Samsung Galaxy Note 9,10/03/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/03/video-smackdown-comparing-the-iphone-xs-max-versus-the-samsung-galaxy-note-9,"With a bunch of improvements to the camera in the iPhone XS comes improvements in video capture as well. AppleInsider shoots some footage, and pits the iPhone XS Max against the Samsung Galaxy Note 9.
Apple says that the new iPhone XS and XS Max get better low-light performance while recording video, as well as extended dynamic range while shooting up to 30 frames per second. Both new phones can now record audio in stereo, as well as record video in 1080P at 60 frames per second with the selfie camera
The Samsung Galaxy Note 9 camera has similar 12MP sensors behind the telephoto and wide lenses. It can shoot 4K in 60 frames per second, but unfortunately, it's limited to 5 minutes of recording per clip at that resolution. If the user cuts that back to 1080p at 60 frames per second, the limit is increased to 10 minutes —still far short of the iPhone.
The iPhone XS Max, and basically every other iPhone is only limited by the available storage space, no matter what quality or settings you choose. 
We went out to Coeur d'Alene, Idaho and recorded a bunch of video footage so we could see how Apple's new iPhone XS Max performs compares to the Samsung Galaxy Note 9. Selfie camera recording
The Note 9 can shoot in QHD (1440x2560) with the selfie camera, which looks more detailed than the iPhone XS Max 1080p selfie recording. However, video stabilization gets turned off on the Note 9 while recording in QHD, and the difference is noticeable.
We also saw a pretty substantial difference in dynamic range. The iPhone XS Max does much better in this regard, maintaining the sky's color and detail.Dynamic range
With the wide lens on the rear-facing camera, the iPhone XS Max did a lot better than the Note 9 in terms of video stabilization. By looking at the darkest areas of the trees in the background, we noticed better dynamic range on the iPhone XS Max. 
Not only that, but the sky retained more of its blue color, even though the Galaxy Note 9 image is obviously more saturated. The only complaint with the iPhone XS Max footage is the lack of contrast, making it look less detailed than the Galaxy Note 9's footage.
With the telephoto lenses, both phones have a similar level of detail, but the extra contrast on the Note 9 looks better. We see pretty much the same results as with the wide lens in a telephoto test. 
Both phones do pretty well at dynamic range. However, if we take a look a the boats in the shade on the left side of the frame, the iPhone XS Max is able to lighten up the shadows better than the Note 9. 4K Video stabilization
One thing we noticed is that if you turn on AF Tracking on the Galaxy Note 9, video stabilization gets turned off automatically, making the Note 9's footage look substantially more shaky compared to the iPhone XS Max. 
On the iPhone, autofocus performance is exceptional, without needed to use a feature like AF Tracking. There's also no cases of certain features being disabled while using other features. Back to the test, the stabilization on the iPhone XS Max was outstanding.
Doing the same stabilization test except recording in 4K at 60 frames per second, the Galaxy Note 9 performs noticeably better than the iPhone XS Max. We think it's because the AF Tracking mode is unavailable while shooting in 4K at 60 frames per second, so video stabilization may have automatically turned back on.Autofocus performance
While testing the stabilization, we noticed some autofocusing issues on the Galaxy Note 9. Occasionally, it would decide to focus on the background, even with a face right in front of it. The iPhone XS Max never lost focus on the subject.
We then tested the autofocus by getting very close to a display case. Both phones tracked focus very well. When we backed up the cameras, the Note 9 went out of focus for a second, while the XS Max kept the focus locked in during any movements. 
We tested the dynamic range again, by filming the underneath of a patio umbrella against the side of a building which was in direct sunlight. For this test, we used the telephoto lenses and noticed more stabilization issues while shooting in 4K at 30 frames per second.
The building was a bit blown out on the Galaxy Note 9, and the umbrella was darker than on the iPhone. So the iPhone XS Max was able to retain the highlight details, have brighter low-light details and it showed much more color in the sky compared to the Galaxy Note 9.
Next up, we tested autofocus speed by placing a hand in front of the cameras. Here, the Galaxy Note 9  auto-focused quicker than the iPhone XS Max.
We then decided to run the same test, except by quickly panning between trees in the background and a face in the foreground.
At normal speed, it's hard to tell what's going on, but if you look at the individual frames, the iPhone XS Max was focusing on the face the instant it came into the frame. The Note 9 had quite a bit of lag adjusting the focus when compared to the iPhone.Slow-motion video
We first compared video quality while shooting in 1080p at 240 frames per second by kicking some sand into the air. 
We instantly noticed that the Note 9's image was extremely dark compared to the iPhone XS Max. There was hardly any detail at all in the pants and shoes. You might think that it was underexposed quite a bit, but if you look at the top of the frame, the reflection in the water is just as blown out as on the iPhone XS Max. The white balance on the Note 9 was noticeably too warm as well.
The iPhone XS Max performed well in terms of dynamic range in this test, but we did notice some stabilization issues with it's footage.
We tested the slow-motion capabilities by recording a fountain that was in direct sunlight. We first recording in 4K at 30 frames per second to show the normal speed, and we noticed much better dynamic range on the iPhone XS Max, since the water on the Galaxy Note 9's image was blown out.
We then switched both phones to record in 4K at 60 frames per second. Both phones looked great, but the Note 9 was still blowing out some of the highlight details.
When we switched both phones to 1080P at 240 frames per second, the dynamic range on the Note 9 got substantially worse, just like we saw in the kicking sand test. 
Not only are the shadows much darker, but the water seems to be even more blown out. Dynamic range got a little bit worse on the XS Max, but not nearly as much as on the Note 9. If you look closely, you'll notice that the XS Max has more detail in this mode as well.
The Galaxy Note 9 also comes with a super slow-motion video recording feature. It's able to record at 960 frames per second in very short bursts between 0.2 and 0.4 seconds, limited to 720p. Dynamic range seems to stay the same as with the 1080p 240fps mode, but the quality takes a big hit.
But on the other hand, the iPhone XS Max lacks a super slow-motion feature to that extent, so even the quality is low, it's still nice to have a feature like this on the Note 9.
We decided to do one more test comparing 1080p 240fps on the iPhone XS Max versus the 720p 960fps super slow-mo feature on the Note 9.
This time, I jumped off a ledge onto the beach. One thing we instantly noticed is that the Note 9's super slow-mo feature crops in a great deal on the frame, which is usually an indication of the processor or sensor not being powerful enough to record the full sensor at that many frames per second.
The difference in detail was massive, but the dynamic range was just as good as on the XS Max. Despite the quality difference, the super slow-mo feature provided a more fun and interesting view compared to the XS Max.Low-light video
We then went indoors to test how both cameras performed in low-light. First, using the wide lens in 4K at 30 frames per second, the iPhone XS Max showed impressive dynamic range. The painting on the wall was exposed well, while the Galaxy Note 9 blew out some of the details. You can also visually see the difference by looking at the hot spot on the wall from the lamp.
The darkest areas of the scene, including my face, are brighter on the XS Max. There's also a little bit less noise on the iPhone as well. To make it even worse for the Note 9, the white balance is way too warm, while the iPhone XS Max was extremely close to what we saw with our own eyes.
Using the selfie camera, we saw more detail on the XS Max' image. However, there was less noise with the Note 9. We also noticed that some of the shadow details on the Note 9 were crushed, specifically the hair.
Recording bright city lights near the end of the night probably shows the largest difference in dynamic range between both cameras. As you can see, the Comfort Inn sign is completely blown out on the Note 9, and the color appears to be white compared to the true-to-life blue on the XS Max. 
Even from a distance, you can easily read the word ""Comfort"" on the XS Max' image. Looking at the rest of the scene, it's easy to see the differences in dynamic range. One might argue that the Note 9 was exposed a tad bit brighter than the XS Max, but it's the camera software's job to properly look at the scene and adjust the exposure for the best results. 
Obviously, the iPhone XS Max was able to get the exposure just right. And once again, the iPhone XS Max more accurately represents the white balance that we saw with our eyes.
Overall, the iPhone XS Max is the winner of this comparison, thanks to much better dynamic range, better color accuracy, better stabilization apart from 4K at 60 frames per second, better quality slow-motion capture, faster face detection autofocus and better low-light recording.

Apple Insider,"Amazon updates Fire TV Stick with 4K, Dolby Atmos, all HDR standards",10/03/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/03/amazon-updates-fire-tv-stick-with-4k-dolby-atmos-all-hdr-standards,"Amazon on Wednesday launched a new version of its Fire TV Stick, adding not just 4K video but support for Dolby Atmos surround sound and all three major HDR (high dynamic range) formats.
Supported HDR standards include HDR10, HDR10+, and Dolby Vision. Relatively few streaming devices support Dolby Vision, the best-known example being the Apple TV 4K. Even the Fire TV Cube, released earlier this year, only supports HDR10 and HDR10+.
Vision and HDR10+ are notable for enabling dynamic metadata, which can produce more detail in highlights and shadows on compatible TVs.
Dolby Atmos simulates sound in 3D space, rather than simply pushing sounds to specific channels. Apple only introduced Atmos support to the Apple TV with September's tvOS 12 update, a year after it announced plans.
Another significant update is the Stick's remote, which will finally have its own power, mute, and volume controls.
The Fire TV Stick 4K will cost $49.99, $10 more than its predecessor, and ship in North America on Oct. 31. The U.K. will get the product on Nov. 14."
Apple Insider,Wi-Fi spec naming getting simplified with new numbering scheme,10/03/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/03/wi-fi-spec-naming-getting-simplified-with-new-numbering-scheme,"The Wi-Fi Alliance is rebranding the terms used to identify different types of Wi-Fi connection in a bid to simplify the naming system for the general public, with 802.11ac being retroactively renamed ""Wi-Fi 5"" and the next-generation 802.11ax technology arriving next year as the more easily understood ""Wi-Fi 6."" 
The current naming system for network specifications, prefixed by 802.11 followed by a letter, is considered by the Wi-Fi Alliance to be difficult to determine which is the newest and what older technologies it can work with on the same network. Instead of relying on users to know which letter suffix is newer, the organization instead intends to simply number each generation of technology sequentially. 
Rather than refer to 802.11ac or 802.11n, they will also be referred to as Wi-Fi 5 and Wi-Fi 4 henceforth, due to their respective generations, with older technologies also being referred to by their generational number. The system should also help consumers by advising of compatibility, with higher-numbered devices supporting connectivity with other hardware with lower numbers, at the older speeds. 
Notably the Wi-Fi Alliance is only going as far back as Wi-Fi 4 for the naming system, with the first to third generation 802.11b, a, and g retaining their original designations. 
""For nearly two decades, Wi-Fi users have had to sort through technical naming conventions to determine if their devices support the latest Wi-Fi,"" said alliance president and CEO Edgar Figueroa. ""Wi-Fi Alliance is excited to introduce Wi-Fi 6, and present a new naming scheme to help industry and Wi-Fi users easily understand the Wi-Fi generation supported by their device or connection."" 
The Wi-Fi Alliance, which counts Apple as a member, intends for the new naming method to be used from the introduction of Wi-Fi 6 in 2019, formerly known as 802.11ax. The organization also intends for the introduction of new visual aids that incorporate the number, which could be used in manuals and on packaging to indicate the generational compatibility. 
In June, the alliance started to certify devices for WPA3, an update to the aging WPA2 security protocol that enhances authentication and encryption measures."
Apple Insider,What you need to know about the 'Presidential Alert' coming to your iPhone on Wednesday,10/03/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/03/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-presidential-alert-coming-to-your-iphone-on-wednesday,"If you live in the U.S., expect to hear a familiar warning tone on your iPhone later on Wednesday — this time, however, regardless of which part of the country you live in and what your alert settings are. AppleInsider delves into Wednesday's Presidential Alert system test.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will be issuing a ""Presidential Alert"" to cellphones at 2:18 Eastern time, or 11:18 Pacific. ""THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System,"" a pop-up message should read. ""No action is needed.""
Despite the name, the alert is not coming directly from the president's desk or smartphone. Rather, in the case of a nationwide emergency, FEMA officials organize with other agencies and the White House before pushing out a message. 
FEMA is required to test the National Wireless Emergency Alert System at least once every three years, and since the law behind the system was only passed in 2016, this is the first such trial run. All major phone carriers are participating.
The Presidential alert should sound like the AMBER and weather alerts Americans are used to, but with some important differences. It can't be turned off, and will even reach phones that aren't activated or are missing a SIM card. Only devices that are fully powered off or in the middle of a phone call should go undisturbed.
If you own an Apple Watch, you may also see the alert appear there, so long as it's connected to your iPhone.
FEMA was originally planning to run today's test in September, but that was delayed as the agency had to respond to a real emergency, Hurricane Florence."
Apple Insider,Availability shrinking for LG UltraFine 5K Display at Apple Stores,10/03/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/03/availability-shrinking-for-lg-ultrafine-5k-display-at-apple-stores,"The online Apple Store is no longer offering in-store pickup for the LG UltraFine 5K Display for a large number of outlets around the globe, a possible indication that the screens may be replaced by a new model, potentially even the anticipated Apple-produced displays. 
Attempts to check the availability of the LG UltraFine 5K Display for in-store pickup in the United States provides the message ""Unavailable for Pickup"" in many locations, in AppleInsider's testing. In some areas, such as New York City, there is limited stock available for the display. 
The unavailability is unusual as Apple has offered store pickup options for the display since its launch, and highlighted it along with the 2016 MacBook Pro redesign.
The Apple Website in other markets also offers similar notifications that it is unavailable as a pick-up order, with regional online stores for Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Australia. Not all markets are listed as completely unavailable, as pickup is still available in Singapore. 
While store pickup is not available in the majority of cases, it does appear that customers are still able to order the monitor for delivery.
Some stores revealed to AppleInsider the LG monitor hasn't been restocked for a while, with multiple locations said to have sold out ""weeks ago"" with no new shipments. The current belief expressed to AppleInsider is that retail will sell-through its existing stock and won't receive any further shipments. 
Typically, a global reduction of availability for a product in the online Apple Store is an indication that something will be changing, such as its removal, a replacement with an Apple-produced version, or an upgraded model. While not completely global, the unavailability for pickup is significant enough to consider there to be something happening soon to the product line. 
There isn't an obvious reason for the reduced availability, but considering the LG monitor arrived at a time when Thunderbolt 3-equipped monitors were rare, and that market now has many Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C-compatible monitors, it is less of an issue for consumers wanting such a display for their Mac. 
Apple did advise in 2017 it was working on a new ""pro display"" to go with a new Mac Pro, originally slated for launch in 2018. While the Mac Pro is now believed to be shipping in 2019, it is possible for Apple to ship the display separately, possibly even earlier than the Mac Pro itself."
Apple Insider,Apple joins other tech giants denouncing Australia encryption backdoor proposals,10/03/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/03/apple-joins-other-tech-giants-denouncing-australia-encryption-backdoor-proposals,"Apple is joining Alphabet, Amazon, and Facebook in opposing a proposed law in Australia that would force companies to provide law enforcement officials access to encrypted data for the purposes of fighting crime, or face steep penalties. 
The four companies will be lobbying the government to denounce the proposals, the Alliance for a Safe and Secure Internet group confirmed to Reuters, with the tech giants working together in attempting to convince lawmakers to alter the bill ahead of a parliamentary vote, expected to take place within weeks. 
Appearing in a list of legislation proposed for introduction in the spring parliamentary sittings in August, the bill attempts to make it easier for security agencies and the police to investigate crimes and potential national security risks by ordering other entities to provide assistance. Though not specified explicitly, the assistance could potentially demand the creation of some form of security backdoor, which would weaken the overall security of the company's services. 
""Any kind of attempt by interception agencies, as they are called in the bill, to create tools to weaken encryption is a huge risk to our digital security, said Alliance spokeswoman Lizzie O'Shea. 
The wording of the bill suggested agencies would be able to demand services offer ways to see the data, potentially by acquiring the data at the user's end before it is encrypted and sent over the Internet rather than creating an encryption backdoor. While this would eliminate the need for a backdoor for encryption itself, adding such a ""feature"" to an app would most likely erode the public's trust of that company. 
""It isn't necessary to give law enforcement agencies access to a decryption key otherwise under the sole control of a user,"" advised Minister for Law Enforcement and Cyber Security Angus Taylor in June. ""We simply don't need to weaken encryption in order to get what we need."" 
The penalties for the bill are hefty, with the proposal suggesting a fine of up to A$10 million ($7.2 million) for companies and institutions who do not comply with a court request for private data. Individuals facing the same request could be imprisoned if they similarly refuse. 
It is believed the attempts by the Australian government to change its laws to require effective backdoor access to data held by tech companies is a test case that could see implementation elsewhere, if it is brought into law. 
The ""Five Eyes"" nations, a group consisting of Australia, Canada, the U.S., the U.K., and New Zealand that share intelligence with each other, said it would continue to push for access to encrypted messages and voice communications through changes to laws, under the guise of protecting national security. 
Apple's involvement in the lobbying group is a continuation of its efforts to fight demands to create backdoors or for any actions that weakens product security. In March, senior VP of software engineering Craig Federighi advised ""Weakening security makes no sense when you consider that customers rely on our products to keep their personal information safe, run their businesses, or even manage vital infrastructure like power grids and transportation systems."" 
Tech companies have also campaigned against the introduction of backdoors in other legislative change attempts, including pressuring the U.K. Parliament to remove the encryption backdoors element from the 2016 Investigatory Powers Bill before passing it, though efforts to add such backdoors continue in the country. 
Efforts are being made to try and protect the United States from implementing similar measures, with the ""Secure Data Act"" proposed in May to theoretically prevent courts and federal agencies from issuing orders to create backdoors or other security-weakening features."
Apple Insider,"Publishers laud Apple News' human touch, wary about monetization prospects",10/02/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/03/publishers-laud-apple-news-human-touch-wary-about-monetization-prospects,"As Apple attempts to woo major publishers to its Apple News platform, the outlets —  many anonymously —  chimed in on the effort, saying human-driven article curation and a massive iOS device install base is winning over some converts. At least for now. 
Speaking with Digiday, publishing executives gave points to Apple for its approach to content curation. Like Apple Music, Apple News relies on human curation in the form of an editorial team tasked with policing content quality.
""They're attentive, and you have the sense they're human beings that are trying to nurture a relationship of some kind,"" said a publishing executive who is in regular contact with Apple. 
Apple News is in many ways the antithesis of Facebook, which is experiencing a media exodus of sorts due to recent troubles over the 2016 elections and a rejiggering of user news feeds designed to quell criticism over conspiracy theories run rampant. 
According to the report, certain top-tier news organizations are in constant conversation with Apple's editorial team. One such outlet, CNN Digital, is in touch with Apple on a daily basis. S. Mitra Kalita, SVP of news, opinion and programming at CNN Digital, says the availability enables the channel to reach a diverse audience. 
""This is very much a human interaction,"" Kalita said. 
She pointed out, however, that monetization options lag behind the competition. Other publishers seemingly agree. New York Post chief digital officer Remy Stern at the Digiday Publishing Summit last week said his publication makes ""hundreds"" in revenue despite catering to an audience that numbers in the ""millions.""
Advertising is typically the main source of revenue for online publications, and Apple's cloistered platform only recently began allowing publishers to serve Google DoubleClick ads. One anonymous publication is looking to make ""a few hundred thousand"" dollars this year through Apple News, while the New York Post estimates it brought in only $600 in six months.
Apple is supposedly pushing for publishers to adopt subscription models, a tactic the company is also applying to apps sold in the App Store. How Apple intends to set its strategy apart from the crowd is unclear, and the company has shared little on the matter with publishing partners. 
""They're very condescending in their approach,"" one anonymous source said. ""It's, 'We're doing this and we'll tell you when we figure it out.'""
Further, Apple currently takes its customary 30-percent cut of all subscription sales, a larger chunk than Facebook and Google. 
That could all change if and when the tech giant rolls out a widely rumored paid service for news and magazines — and potentially video and music content — next year. For now, however, most publishers appear willing to tough it out in hopes that Apple News becomes a key facet in Apple's booming services business."
Apple Insider,"Consumer Reports finds iPhone XS and XS Max last hours longer than iPhone X, contradicts previous tests",10/02/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/02/consumer-reports-finds-iphone-xs-and-xs-max-last-hours-longer-than-iphone-x-contradicts-previous-tests,"Consumer Reports has published their final test results for the iPhone XS and XS Max, yielding yet a few more surprises regarding the newest iPhones.
The biggest news from Consumer Reports testing was apparent battery life improvements. Both the iPhone XS and the XS Max outperformed Apple's reported numbers, and the publication's expectations.
The new iPhone XS was able to go 24.5 hours, while the Max made it 26 hours in lab tests. That compares to the iPhone X, which was a half hour shy of hitting the 20 hour mark. 
For the test, Consumer Reports used a robotic finger programmed to run through a series of tasks on each device, simulating an average user's day. The robot ""browses the internet, takes pictures, uses GPS navigation, and, of course, makes phone calls."" To keep things consistent, they put the display at 100-percent, which means that dropping the brightness could extend evaluation numbers further.
Apple says that the XS should get 30 minutes more out of the battery than the X, and the iPhone XS Max should garner 90 minutes more life before shutting down. These tests — not the same process Apple uses to arrive at its numbers — show the new handsets can in some situations beat Apple's estimates.
The results contradict findings from Tom's Guide, which evaluated the iPhone XS last month. In that round of testing, iPhone X beat out both iPhone XS and XS Max in an endurance test involving web browsing over LTE. Consumer Reports knocked Apple for the included charging brick, noting it took 210 minutes, or twice as long, to charge the iPhone XS Max compared to the Samsung Note 9. Apple could easily remedy the situation by including a USB-C fast charger in the box, something AppleInsider has mentioned repeatedly in our iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max reviews, though the company is unlikely to do so.
Other results in today's test highlight the updated cameras, which beat out last year's top-rated iPhone X.
""iPhone XS and XS Max managed to improve on that performance, if only just a little,"" the publication said. ""The phones received slightly better scores when it came to the quality of the still and video images taken by their rear cameras.""
Performance was also tops thanks to the new A12 Bionic processor, though competing devices like iPhone X and Galaxy Note 9 were only slightly behind."

Apple Insider,"Apple CEO Tim Cook talks privacy, China and Alex Jones with HBO's VICE News Tonight",10/02/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/02/apple-ceo-tim-cook-talks-privacy-china-and-alex-jones-in-vice-news-interview,"In a one-on-one interview with HBO's VICE News Tonight, Apple CEO Tim Cook addressed a series of hard-hitting questions from correspondent Elle Reeves concerning data privacy, Apple's dealings in China, the Alex Jones controversy and more. 
As teased in previous tweets posted to Vice's official account, Cook touched on data privacy rights against the backdrop of government regulation. While he is not pro-regulation, the Apple chief said it is important to get lawmakers up to speed on tech and privacy. That includes ""some level"" of government regulation. 
""Technology itself doesn't want to be good, it doesn't want tot be bad, it doesn't want anything,"" Cook said. ""It's up to the creator, I'm exceedingly optimistic that this subject is now in the vocabulary and getting discussed. And now we've all got to figure out a way to take it to the next level and change some things."" 
On that topic, Reeve presented the idea that Siri could be hindered because Apple refuses to collect customer data. Cook refuted the notion.
""The narrative that some companies will try to get you to believe is, 'I've got to take all of your data to make my service better.' Well, don't believe that,"" Cook said. ""Whoever's telling you that — it's a bunch of bunk.""
Competitors in the space, including Amazon and Google, glean data from user devices to inform and develop new features for their respective voice assistants. Apple's Siri, which is subject to the same stringent privacy protections as other Apple products, is widely viewed as behind Alexa and Google Assistant in terms of functionality. 
""We challenge ourselves to collect as little as possible,"" he said. ""And when we collect, we challenge ourselves to make it not identifiable. And we don't do things like — we don't read your email, we don't read your messages. You are not our product. We're not forming the detailed profile and then allowing other companies to buy the opportunity to target you. That's not the business that we're in.""
Cook went on to defend Apple's decision to adhere to Chinese government policy, a stance that has forced the company to migrate iCloud account data to China-owned servers. The move, privacy advocates say, opens customers up to potential snooping under the strict regime. 
""It's not easy for anybody to get it,"" he said. ""I mean it's it's encrypted like it is everywhere. And so no, I wouldn't I wouldn't get caught up in the, Where's the location of it?' I mean, we have servers located in many different countries in the world. They are not easier to get data from being in one country versus the next.""
Apple recently removed conspiracy theorist Alex Jones from its podcasting platform, as well as the iOS App Store, for violating company policy. Cook commented on the resolution to strike the controversial content.
""What users want from us and what we've always provided them is a curated platform,"" he said. ""We think the what the user wants is someone that does review these apps, someone that does review the podcasts, someone that on like Apple news, where a human is selecting the top stories. And that's what we do. We don't take a political stand. We're not leaning one way or the other. You can tell that from the stuff on the App Store and in podcasts etc. You'll see everything from very conservative to very liberal. And that's the way I think it should be.""
Shortly after Apple first pulled Jones' content from Podcasts and iTunes, other tech companies followed suit. Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg in an interview said the social network followed Apple's lead on the matter. The most punishing blow came when Twitter banned Jones last month. 
Cook in today's interview said he did not discuss the decision with other companies, nor does he know of any conversations between Apple employees and their counterparts at Facebook or Twitter."
Apple Insider,Apple executives net stock incentives worth up to $30.5M,10/02/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/02/apple-executives-net-stock-incentives-worth-up-to-305m,"Apple's highest-ranking executives last week received batches of restricted stock units as part of the company's incentives plan, with many leadership positions netting more than $30 million each.  
Revealed in multiple U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings on Tuesday, the stock incentives were meted out in two transactions dated Sept. 30. 
General Counsel and SVP of Legal and Global Security Katherine Adams, retail chief Angela Ahrendts, CFO Luca Maestri and COO Jeff Williams each received 88,598 RSUs split into in two equal packages.
The first batch of 44,299 RSUs are time-based awards scheduled to vest at three equal intervals over the next five years. The first vesting period lands on April 1, 2021, while the last is slated for April 1, 2023, dependent on continued employment at Apple. 
A second batch of 44,299 RSUs is performance based and requires Apple's relative total shareholder return to meet certain criteria between the first fiscal day of 2019 through the last day of 2021. Depending on performance, up to 200 percent of the RSUs will vest on Oct. 1, 2021. 
If company stock meets expectations, and the executives stay on at their respective current positions, the executives will gain 132,897 common stock units worth nearly $30.5 million at today's stock prices. 
In addition to the incentives, Senior Director of Corporate Accounting Chris Kondo received an award of 8,860 RSUs scheduled to vest at regular intervals over the next four years. 
Apple typically outperforms board-defined goals. In April, top Apple executives including Ahrendts, Maestri, Williams and other SVPs reaped nearly $22 million each in vested stock after the company landed in the top tier of firms listed on the S&P 500. 
Executives missed out on doubling performance-base RSUs in 2016, a year marked by lower-than-expected iPhone sales due to worldwide market contractions."
Apple Insider,Ask Siri to pre-order iPhone XR from the updated Apple Store app,10/02/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/02/ask-siri-to-pre-order-iphone-xr-from-the-updated-apple-store-app,"Apple on Tuesday issued an update to its official Apple Store app, delivering Siri Shortcuts integration that, come Oct. 19, will afford iPhone Upgrade Program subscribers the ability to pre-order iPhone XR using nothing more than their voice. 
Siri Shortcuts integration is the highlight feature of Apple's Apple Store app update, which reached version 5.1.1 today. 
With the new capability, iPhone Upgrade Program members will be able to quickly access the iPhone XR landing page when pre-orders begin on Oct. 19. 
To use the feature, users simply tap the ""Add to Siri"" button during the pre-approval process and record a custom voice command. Apple suggests the phrase ""pre-order my iPhone."" Like iPhone XS and XS Max, the Apple Store app is facilitating pre-approvals to streamline the pre-order process which goes live later this month. 
Once pre-orders begin, those who have saved the Siri Shortcut can trigger Siri using their custom phrase, which pulls up pre-approval information in the App Store app. From there, users need only to complete the order and check out. 
In addition to Siri Shortcuts integration, the Apple Store app update brings support for Apple Watch Series 4's larger screen sizes. 
Unveiled at a special event in September, iPhone XR is Apple's more affordable alternative to this year's flagship X-series handsets. The device boasts cutting edge technologies including the TrueDepth camera system and Face ID biometric security, a revamped rear-facing shooter with single-lens Portrait Mode photography, dual-SIM capability and Apple's new A12 Bionic processor.
Instead of an OLED display, iPhone XR cuts costs by using a 6.1-inch ""Liquid Retina"" LCD screen and aluminum chassis, the latter of which allows Apple to offer the phone in a range of colors.  
Apple is scheduled to take iPhone XR pre-orders live on Oct. 19. Prices start at $749 or $37.41 per month for iPhone Upgrade Program members. 
The Apple Store app for iOS is a free 86.8MB download from the App Store."
Apple Insider,Apple to reveal Q4 2018 earnings on Nov. 1,10/02/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/02/apple-to-reveal-q4-2018-earnings-on-nov-1,"Apple on Tuesday announced plans to report quarterly earnings for the fourth quarter of 2018 at the end of trading on Nov. 1, when company executives could reveal an initial glimpse at iPhone XS and XS Max sales performance.   
Announced in an update to its Investor Relations webpage, Apple's fourth quarter conference call is scheduled for Thursday, Nov.1, at 2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern. 
As with past earnings calls, CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri are expected to provide detailed analysis and numbers for the three-month period ending in September. The pair will also field questions from investment analysts. 
While the quarterly report is unlikely to exhibit material impact from last month's iPhone XS and Apple Watch Series 4 debut, Cook and Maestri might offer color on the new products' performance over what will be seven weeks. 
The company is coming off its best June quarter ever, when it brought in $53.3 billion in revenue on the back of 41.3 million iPhone sales. With a higher mix of premium handset sales, revenue from iPhones hit $29.9 billion for the quarter, up 20 percent from $24.8 billion in 2017. The high-end iPhone X maintained its spot as Apple's most popular iPhone model, driving the smartphone's average selling price to $724. 
Services also grew during the period, marking the 13th straight quarter of double-digit gains. Wearables, which includes products like Apple Watch and AirPods, grew 60 percent during the three-month period.
""Our Q3 results were driven by continued strong sales of iPhone, Services and Wearables, and we are very excited about the products and services in our pipeline,"" Cook said at the time.
Following news of the monster quarterly performance, Apple stock prices hit $200 for the first time since it split four years ago. Apple also became the first U.S. company to reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion.  
For the September quarter, Apple is forecasting revenue between $60 billion and $62 billion with a gross margin between 38 percent and 38.5 percent. 
AppleInsider will offer full coverage of the earnings call on Thursday, Nov. 1, starting at 2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern."
Apple Insider,"Microsoft unveils Surface Pro 6, Surface Laptop 2 & Surface Studio 2",10/02/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/02/microsoft-unveils-surface-pro-6-surface-laptop-2-surface-studio-2,"At a Tuesday press event Microsoft revealed three new computers in its touch-capable Surface line, leading with the Surface Pro 6, a competitor to both iPads and MacBooks.
The Pro 6 has a redesigned interior for improved cooling, allowing Microsoft to offer eighth-generation quad-core Intel processors as well as 13.5 hours of battery life. The tablet is said to be 67 percent faster than its predecessor.
The device has a 12.3-inch display, and can be configured with up to 16 gigabytes of RAM. It will go on sale in black and platinum colors, starting at $899 for a Core i5 model.
The Surface Laptop 2 is claimed to be 85 percent faster thanks to eighth-gen Intel processors, and have a quieter keyboard, but is otherwise unchanged with a 13.5-inch display and 14.5 hours of battery life. The most important difference compared to the first Laptop may actually be price, since the cheapest model will be $100 less at $899.
Microsoft's new all-in-one desktop, the Surface Studio 2, is headlined by an improved display that's 38 percent brighter with 22 percent more contrast and support for tilt functions with the Surface Pen. 
The computer's Nvidia graphics chip is 50 percent faster, and a hybrid storage drive has been swapped for a 2-terabyte SSD. Combined with an upgraded CPU, Microsoft is touting the product as he ""fastest Surface ever.""
Finally, Microsoft took the wraps off a pair of $350 Surface Headphones. The light gray cans feature user-adjustable noise-canceling technology that can be tuned by turning a dial on the left ear cup. A corresponding dial on the right ear piece controls volume, while four beam-forming microphones — two per ear — provide high quality voice reproduction. ""Hey Cortana"" voice control is also included. 
The Pro 6 and Laptop 2 are both launching Oct. 16. No date or price has been set for the Studio 2. Surface Headphones are due to ship in time for the holiday shopping season in the U.S."
Apple Insider,"Tim Cook to appear on HBO's Vice News to discuss privacy, more",10/02/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/02/tim-cook-to-appear-on-hbos-vice-news-to-discuss-privacy-more,"Apple CEO Tim Cook will appear in a one-on-one interview with HBO's Vice News on Tuesday, where he is set to discuss hot-button issues including data privacy and encryption. 
Announced in a tweet on Monday, Cook is set to take on a variety of hard-hitting questions from Vice correspondent Elle Reeve. While the clip provided fails to offer a broad overview of what will be discussed in the session, Reeve dedicates a portion of the interview to user privacy. 
In a clip appended to Monday's tweet, Reeve asks Cook if Apple's stance on privacy will negatively impact Siri. The presumption implies Siri is unable to compete with voice assistant technology from Amazon and Google because it lacks access to deep customer data.
Cook offered a typical response, intimating that Siri's underlying technology can be advanced without leaning on information harvested from iPhone, iPad and Mac users. 
A second tweet on Tuesday includes a second clip, again focusing on customer protections, in which Reeve asks Cook to list examples when Apple chose customer privacy over profit.  
Again, Cook echoed past comments on the matter, noting Apple does not view the customer as a product. 
Cook's interview will air tonight at 7:30 p.m. Eastern on HBO."
Apple Insider,Apple Music scores exclusive playlist deal with Ministry of Sound at expense of Spotify listeners,10/02/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/02/apple-music-scores-exclusive-playlist-deal-with-ministry-of-sound-at-expense-of-spotify-listeners,"Apple has signed a pact with the famous dance/downtempo label Ministry of Sound, giving the former exclusive rights to branded playlists on Apple Music — and dealing a blow to the global leader in on-demand music, Spotify.
The first Apple Music MoS playlists will launch this Thursday, Oct. 4, Apple informed Variety. A separate, anonymous source told the publication that MoS will pull its playlists from Spotify and other music services in the next few days.
The move is bound to upset many Spotify subscribers, since MoS has several popular playlists on the service, such as ""Dance Nation"" and ""Sunday Chill."" Dance Nation alone has over 273,000 followers.
Apple and Spotify have been regularly trading shots with each other since Apple Music launched in 2015. Spotify retains an overwhelming lead, with 83 million paid customers versus Apple's reported 45 million, but the latter is now barely ahead in the North American market.
Most recently rapper Nicki Minaj accused Spotify of withdrawing promotion for her new album after she launched a show on Apple's Beats 1 radio. Apple has used its wealth to secure a number of high-profile exclusives, and enjoys a home-field advantage on iPhones and iPads, since its service is not only pre-installed on them but the only one that can be controlled directly with Siri."

Apple Insider,"AAPL ends day with new closing high of $229.28, hit $230 during trading",10/02/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/02/aapl-ends-day-with-new-closing-high-of-22928-hit-230-during-trading,"Apple has set yet another record in the financial markets today, with the trillion-dollar company hitting $230.00 during trading and achieving a new all-time closing high of $229.28 on October 2. 
Opening at $227.25 from a previous close of $227.26, the price of AAPL quickly rose to $229, hovering close to $230 and briefly touching the figure. At the end of the trading day, the price per share finished at $229.28, beating the previous closing high of $228.36 on September 1, which itself was increasing the record $227.63 one day earlier. 
The shift in stock price arrives approximately ten days after the release of the premium iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, and two weeks before the release of the iPhone XR. The iPhone is a major revenue source for Apple, and early sales reports from analysts anticipate high shipment numbers by the end of the launch period of up to 80 million iPhones. 
The new record is the latest in a number of financial events that have kept investors happy. One day after the July 31 quarterly earnings report, Apple's stock hit $200 per share for the first time since the company's stock split in 2014. 
One day later, Apple became the first American company in history to achieve a market capitalization of $1 trillion. Currently, Apple's market capitalization lies north of $1.1 trillion. 
Ahead of the launch of the iPhone XS, it was discovered Apple was the most-shorted company at $9.8 billion on September 10, the highest of any U.S. company."
Apple Insider,When to expect Apple's October event and what we're expecting to see,10/02/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/02/when-to-expect-apples-october-event-and-what-were-expecting-to-see,"Once again, only Apple knows for sure when —or even if —it will hold an event this month, but it does seem very likely that Apple will want to capture the minds of consumers for two consecutive months. AppleInsider reveals why it's harder to predict a date for this one —and what we can expect to see when it comes.
Two things happen the moment Apple's regular September event is over. Outside the company, we all wonder when or whether there will be another in October. And inside Apple, someone starts work on the next typically cryptic invitation.
What we all like when looking forward is hard evidence —and there is some. There's strong reason to believe Apple will hold an event this month even though it didn't last October. There's also interesting historical evidence for when the event might be.
It's just that the same historical evidence makes it more difficult to predict a single date than we did with the September one.History in the making
Steve Jobs died on October 5, 2011, the day after that year's October event where Apple had revealed Siri and the iPhone 4S. Since then there have been four October events in the seven years to date.
Three of those have taken place in the fourth week of the month and the only exception is 2014 when it was in the third week instead. From 2011 to 2014, Apple ran these October events on a Tuesday; since then it's been on a Thursday —if it's happened at all.
The two years that skipped having an October event were 2015 and last year, 2017.
That 2015 omission is interesting. This was the year that the 4K Retina iMac was updated. That was on October 13, 2015, and at the same time we saw the Magic Mouse 2 and the Magic Trackpad 2. Two weeks later on October 26 we got the fourth generation Apple TV.
If the peripherals and the TV are reasonably small announcements, still Apple brought out that iMac refresh with just a press release like it did in 2018 to the MacBook Pro.
Then last year, there wasn't an October event and there weren't any October product launches either.Trying to pick a date
Apple did famously drop out of the old Macworld conference because the company didn't like being held to another firm's annual schedule. It just segued into having its own annual schedule instead. At least, though, Apple can pick whatever date suits it and its manufacturing chain —except no, it can't.
Samsung is launching a new Galaxy device on Tuesday October 11 so you can picture calendars in Apple Park with that date crossed out. 
Then we do already know something about Apple's October plans because they've told us. The iPhone XR will be available to pre-order from October 19 and it will start shipping on October 26. Those are both Fridays: assume, then, that the phones will begin arriving in people's hands from Saturday, October 27.It's not like they just made one phone
It's a gigantic, simply gigantic job getting those phones to those people. Apple may not own the couriers, it may not fly the aircraft transporting them across the world. Yet just because Apple is used to it, that doesn't make the logistics any easier or any less of a stress on the company.
The iPhone XR starts at $749, a full $250 less than the iPhone XS, and it's expected that this price difference will make it the best-selling iPhone this year. 
Analysts such as Ming-Chi Kuo estimate that overall Apple will sell some 85 million new iPhones of all types by the end of the year. However, the iPhone XR looks likely to account for over half of that .
So, while the estimated figures do specifically cover up to 2019, still you can reasonably expect that the majority will be sold at launch. So from October 26 there could be something approaching 30 million iPhone XR boxes en route to customers.
Back in 2014 when the iPhone 6 was coming out, anecdotal evidence from pilots said that Apple had chartered between 20 and 30 Boeing 747 aircraft purely to carry phones. Each aircraft was estimated to carry 195,000 iPhones. 
That Apple can sell this many phones and that it can cope with shipping that many at the same time is remarkable. However, doing all of that and then releasing new iPad Pro models or iMacs shipping at the same time, fighting for air freight space wouldn't be remarkable, it would be foolhardy.Theatrics
Apple is very smart about knowing when to release items to get the most publicity and attention for them. You can argue that they've already launched the iPhone XR, yet the 19th and the 26th will see a lot of limelight focused on them. 
There's nothing to say that Apple couldn't hold another event even as the iPhone XR finally launches, yet it doesn't seem likely for such a news-aware firm.
Then, too, there is another event outside Apple's control: the annual Jamf conference runs from October 23 to 25. Jamf is a system for corporate and enterprise customers to manage gigantic numbers of iOS devices. So some of the very people you want to be watching as you launch, say, a new iPad Pro, are going to be a bit tied up for those three days.
It might be nice if those people at the Jamf conference were fully briefed about any new iOS devices so you could reasonably expect that Apple has timed its event to happen before that. Only, if you exclude the years Apple didn't do an October event, there has been only one Jamf conference that took place after a special event.
That was Jamf 2014, which began five days after Apple's October 16, 2014 reveal. Other than that, in 2013 and 2016, the conference was about a week before Apple's launches.
There is one more historical fact that may point to when this year's event will be.Invitations
From 2011 to 2016, the last time Apple had an October event, the invitations were sent out with exactly seven days notice —except once. In 2014, the invitation was sent on October 8 for an event on October 16. That's eight days.
So when you even hear that an Apple invitation has been released for an October event, you can guess exactly when the date is.What's in the event
Oddly, this time around it's easier to say what is going to be in the event than when precisely it will be.
That's because there were so many solid rumors backed up by supply chain and other evidence to fill September's event three times over. Sources who got the details right about the new iPhones and Apple Watch Series 4 continue to point to there being more up Apple's sleeves before the end of the year.
Rumors suggest the new iPads will take on design elements from the iPhone X such as the drastically reduced bezel around the display screen. 
Alongside this, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claims that the iPad Pro will come in an updated 12.9-inch model and a brand new 11-inch one.  New Macs
Although this is not as solidly backed up as the iPad rumors, Kuo does also claim that there will be a refreshed iMac. It's specifically said to have an improved screen and, possibly supporting this idea, this week Apple informed its stores that its supplies of some existing iMac screens were low. 
Apple's other desktop, the Mac mini, is similarly rumored to be getting updated with a ""professional"" remake, but more attention from the mainstream consumer is being focused on Kuo's claim that there will be new —and cheaper —MacBooks.Same old, same old
We've stuck to where there is at least decent evidence of a new product coming and we're not even trying to weigh up whether there will be new HomePods, AirPods and the mythical AirPower. There won't be.
What there almost certainly will be, however, is something missed out. Apple tends to be careful and deliberate about what it releases when while those of us predicting from supply evidence tend to be anything but.
The odds are that there will be an October event, and that Apple will release some of these products —and not all. Calling it
Given that we're so keen on hard evidence and given that October 2018 is proving to be an unusually tricky month for Apple to have an event all things considered, still we're going to call it.
Unless Apple just decides to email out a press release and be done with it, we say there'll be an event on Thursday October 25. It'll be at the Steve Jobs Theater and Tim Cook will announce incredible pre-order figures for the iPhone XR.
It will concentrate on the iPad Pro and pre-orders for those will be announced for the end of the month with shipping in November. We're less sold on new Macs at the release, though.
This fits in with everything else in the month and it gets Apple the chance to boast about iPhone XR sales. It also lets them make a splash with a big iPad announcement without then immediately overloading those 747s. And yet it still gives Apple just about the longest run-up to Christmas possible.
Consequently we're pretty sure. We'd even say that we'd put money on this being the right date, but on the one hand we're not sufficiently certain and on the other we want to save that money in case there's a new iMac.Keep up with AppleInsider by downloading the AppleInsider app for iOS, and follow us on YouTube, Twitter @appleinsider and Facebook for live, late-breaking coverage.

Apple Insider,Latest iOS 12.1 beta fixes sporadic iPhone and iPad recharging issues,10/02/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/02/latest-ios-121-beta-fixes-sporadic-iphone-and-ipad-recharging-issues,"A bug in the way iOS 12 handles charging that causes devices to not charge when connected to a power source is on its way to being rectified, with a beta release of iOS 12.1 fixing the problem on iPhones and iPads affected by the issue. 
Over the weekend, reports from users revealed an issue with either the iPhone XS or iOS 12, where the iPhone failed to charge. The issue surfaced regardless of charging method, occurring both when power is applied by a Lightning cable to a common wall charger, or by using wireless charging with a Qi charging pad. 
In some occasions, users would not see a charging symbol showing power was present, nor would hear the charging chime that plays when recharging commences. In some cases, users were able to force the iPhone to detect a power source by plugging it in, waiting between 10 and 15 seconds, and then waking the device. 
The second developer beta for iOS 12.1, released on Tuesday, appears to have fixed the problem. In AppleInsider's tests with an affected iPad Pro and iPhone 7 now running the iOS 12.1 beta, the usual charging notifications sounded every time power was presented to the devices, strongly suggesting that is has been fixed in the beta software release.
It is unclear if the fix will be released earlier than iOS 12.1 in a sub-point release, but it will likely make an appearance as part of the full public release of iOS 12.1, later this fall."
Apple Insider,"Apple offers second betas of iOS 12.1, tvOS 12.1, macOS 10.14.1 Mojave, and watchOS 5.1 for developer testing",10/02/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/02/apple-offers-second-betas-of-ios-121-tvos-121-macos-10141-mojave-and-watchos-51-for-developer-testing,"Apple has provided participants of its developer beta testing program new builds, with the second betas of iOS 12.1, tvOS 12.1, macOS 10.14.1 Mojave and watchOS 5.1 now available to download on to devices six days after the first betas. 
Developers who have signed up for the testing program can use the latest builds after performing an over-the-air update on their enrolled devices, or can follow the instructions from the Apple Developer Center. Public beta versions typically arrive a few days after the developer betas, and can be acquired from the Apple Beta Software Program website. 
The second iOS 12.1 developer beta has build number 16B5068i, replacing the first build's 16B5059d. The following Friday after the build was issued, Apple released additional builds of the beta, allowing owners of the iPhone XS and XS Max to trial the operating system on their brand new devices. 
So far, the iOS 12.1 beta seems to be a minor update, with the main change being the inclusion of support for Group FaceTime. A few minor changes have also been found in the code, such as horizontal Face ID support, which will likely be useful for new iPad models rumored to land later this fall. 
Apple has also teased the addition of 70 new emoji that will be arriving in iOS 12.1, which it has included in the betas. 
Apple's second build of macOS 10.14.1 Mojave is build number 18B50c, up from the first build's 18B45d. 
Few details were provided by Apple as what to expect in the first beta of macOS 10.14.1, but the main addition is the return of Group FaceTime. Just as with iOS 12, the feature was pulled from beta before its release, and has since been returned for testing. 
The second beta of tvOS 12.1's build is number 16J5584c . The first beta was build number 16J5575c. Details about its contents are unknown, but version 12.1 is likely to consist of bug fixes and performance improvements, rather than new features. 
Apple's second watchOS 5.1 beta bears build number 16R5568d, up from the first developer beta build 16R5559d. 
Much like iOS 12.1 and macOS 10.14.1, there is relatively little known about what's included in each beta release. For watchOS 5.1, it gains the ability to answer Group FaceTime calls on the Apple Watch, with it able to handle the call via audio until the user can access an iOS device to continue in video. AppleInsider, and Apple itself, strongly advise againstinstalling beta releases on mission-critical hardware, due to the possibility of data loss and other issues. Those interested in testing the betas out should use non-essential devices, and to keep backups of any important data before installing or performing updates.Find any changes in the new betas?

Apple Insider,Apple teases iOS 12.1 release that will add 70 new emoji to Messages,10/02/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/02/apple-teases-ios-121-release-that-will-add-70-new-emoji-to-messages,"More than 70 new emoji will be coming soon to iOS 12 and macOS Mojave, including new characters with red hair, gray hair and curly hair, a new emoji for bald people, more emotive smiley faces and additional emoji representing animals, sports and food.
Beyond the new physical traits, sports fans get new softball, frisbee and lacrosse, emoji with outdoor adventurers getting luggage, compass and a hiking boot to accompany the existing climbing emoji.
Animals included are the llama, mosquito, swan and raccoon, that will join the kangaroo, lobster, parrot and peacock previewed on World Emoji Day
The new emoji are included in Tuesday's developer and public beta releases of iOS 12.1. Apple says that they will be available in upcoming software updates for iOS, macOS and watchOS.
Apple had previously mentioned the additions . Apple's new emoji characters are created based on the approved characters in Unicode 11.0, with the company saying that they are working with the group to add more disability-themed emoji to the keyboard for Unicode 12.0, slated for release in 2019."
Apple Insider,Apple donates $1M to Indonesia earthquake and tsunami relief efforts,10/02/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/02/apple-donates-1m-to-indonesia-earthquake-and-tsunami-relief-efforts,"Apple CEO Tim Cook has announced Apple is donating $1 million to help relief efforts taking place in Indonesia after the recent earthquake and tsunami, in a continuation of the iPhone producer's charitable efforts following major disasters over the years. 
Posting to Twitter, Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed the donation by the company is taking place, adding ""Our hearts go out to the people of Sulawesi and all of Indonesia after this weekend's devastating earthquake and tsunami."" 
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake hit near the central island of Sulawesi, triggering a tsunami that landed at the city of Palu, reports the BBC. Disaster response officials have so far declared the death toll of the natural disaster at over 1,300 people, and the number is likely to rise as the full impact of the events are examined in the coming days and weeks. 
Incidents of looting are being cracked down on by law enforcement officials, following a brief period where survivors acquired basic goods, with humanitarian relief convoys and food supplies arriving two days after the event. The United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates there are close to 200,000 people in need of assistance, with a quarter of those said to be children. 
The donation to the Sulawesi relief effort is one of a number of similar offers of aid provided by Apple in the event of major catastrophes. Before Sulawesi, Apple pledged a $1 million donation to the American Red Cross, to help those affected by Hurricane Florence. 
In August, Apple opened its iTunes donation mechanism to help victims of the Kerala floods in India, as well as pledging 70,000,000 rupees (approximately $1 million) to support Mercy Corps efforts in the region. 
Earlier in the same month, iTunes donations were accepted to the American Red Cross for the California wild fires. Apple also launched initiatives to support the U.S. national park system on August 23, including pledging to donate some of the proceeds of Apple Pay transactions to the National Park Foundation for a week. 
In 2017, Apple contributed $5 million to the ""Hand in Hand"" hurricane relief effort following Hurricane Harvey, matched worker donations two-to-one to provide California wildfire relief with $1 million in October, and provided another $1 million to assist in rebuilding and recovery efforts following the wildfires in December."
Apple Insider,"Early iMac 5K display assembly reportedly in short supply, free delayed repairs offered",10/02/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/02/early-imac-5k-display-assembly-reportedly-in-short-supply-free-delayed-repairs-offered,"Looking to keep owners happy, Apple is offering compensation to some owners of the late 2014 and mid-2015 iMac 5K coming in for screen repairs and finding parts in short supply, AppleInsider can confirm.
The company's display supply will be limited until mid- to late December. Apple is telling at least some service providers that if someone comes in for a repair due to non-accidental damage, they should offer a free repair once displays are back in stock. If a customer is unwilling to wait, Apple is offering $600 off an equivalent 27-inch 2017 iMac. Accepting the discount for a replacement does mean leaving the old computer with the company.
The arrangement is also limited to people needing out-of-warranty repairs, since people who do fall under warranty are being serviced as usual. People bringing in iMacs with broken screens caused by reckless or deliberate treatment, and/or exposure to liquid, are ineligible for the new program.
The memo was originally obtained by MacRumors. AppleInsider subsequently confirmed that it exists, but only a small handful of repair venues contacted have the memo for reasons as yet unknown.
Apple has yet to update the iMac this year with just two months to go. If it does release a 2018 refresh, it will presumably happen in October, carrying over improvements from the iMac Pro such as its T2 chip responsible for system management and other behind-the-scenes tasks."
Apple Insider,Review: Jaybird's X4 sport headphones win on price-to-performance,10/02/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/02/review-jaybirds-x4-sport-headphones-win-on-price-to-performance,"The X4 is a further refinement of Jaybird's sport earbuds, and both a solid and cheaper alternative to Apple's Powerbeats3.
The barrier for sports headphones is simultaneously high and low. In one sense, any headphones will do — you can pick up a cheap Mpow set on Amazon and if you're not picky they should do the trick, at least until they break.
Longevity is what separates good sport headphones from mediocre ones. Unless you're willing to keep spending money, you'll need sweatproofing to keep them from shorting out. They should also fit securely and comfortably enough to last a complete workout, and sound good enough that you enjoy everything you're hearing, even in a loud gym.
The X4 checks most or all of these boxes. On a basic level they're IPX7 waterproof — they'll protect against sweat and rain, in other words, just don't wear them in the shower or drop them in the pool.
Ergonomics are always subjective with headphones, and the situation is no different here. Jaybird relies on its signature fins to keep buds in place — in my case I found that except for occasional adjustments, they worked even during intense exercise. 
Three sizes are included in the box, of which we chose the biggest pair. Owners of previous X-series headphones will be glad to hear that Jaybird redesigned the fins for this generation, rounding them off while making them less flimsy. The result is both more comfortable and practical.
Jaybird also includes a shirt clip, two sizes of silicone tips, and two sizes of Comply foam tips. I stuck with the default large silicone tips, but I highly recommend experimenting before you head off to the gym. A poor fit will be too loose and produce weaker isolation and bass.
Sound quality is above average, with reasonably clear highs and mids, though bass addicts will probably prefer Beats. I say this having tested a wide variety of material, from ambient and podcasts to trance, thrash metal, and industrial. 
One of the benefits of going with Jaybird is that its MySound iPhone app can be used to tweak EQ settings on the fly. You can adjust them manually, or turn to presets created by Jaybird as well as athletes, musicians, and regular users. We mostly stuck with ""Extended Listening,"" but some people might prefer settings like ""Bring the Bass"" or (yes, that's right) ""Better Than Beats.""
There are relatively few downsides to the X4, all told. One is that you essentially have to adjust the EQ, since the headphones are tuned to be flat by default. You can also only pair with one Bluetooth device at a time, which is inconvenient if you expect to alternate between your iPhone and a wearable. If you skip pairing with your phone, there's no way to tweak the EQ from a device like an Apple Watch.
We're also not a fan of Jaybird's proprietary charger, and eight hours of battery life is a potential downside. People with regular fitness routines will want to charge at least once a week, and likely more often than that if they're into activities like hiking, bodybuilding, or long-distance running.Conclusions
If I'm honest, I expect to go back to my Powerbeats3 partly because I do prefer the extra bass, but mostly because I find hooks to be more reliable for keeping things in place. Fins can help stop buds from falling out — hooks guarantee it.
Unless those caveats apply to you too however, it's hard to beat what the X4 offers for the price. They're an evolution of an already winning formula.Where to buy
The Jaybird X4 wireless sport headphones retail for $129.99 and are available at Amazon and Best Buy with free shipping."

The platform is available to companies in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Singapore, Switzerland, and the U.K., as well as Hong Kong in China. Some early international adopters include Burberry, NH Hotels, Australia's Harvey Norman, Japan's KDDI, the German branch of Vodafone, and the Hong Kong and Singapore branches of Credit Suisse.
Similar to Facebook Messenger's business support, Business Chat lets iPhone and iPad owners shop, book appointments, and get other help through the Messages app. The option appears as a Messages icon when searching for companies through Siri, Safari, Spotlight, or Apple Maps.
U.S. support is still relatively limited, but does include companies like Apple, American Express, Home Depot, Newegg, T-Mobile, and Wells Fargo. 
Business Chat first reached the public with the launch of iOS 11.3 in March. Technically conversations can run on a Mac or Apple Watch as well, but they must be started on an iOS device."
Apple Insider,Nomad launches Shell Cordovan strap for Apple Watch,10/02/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/02/nomad-launches-shell-cordovan-strap-for-apple-watch,"Accessory maker Nomad has released a new genuine Shell Cordovan leather strap just in time for the Apple Watch Series 4.
Shell Cordovan, a high-end leather often used in shoes or wallets, is a rarity in the Apple Watch strap market, though not unseen. It takes a long time to create, six-months in the case of Horween —the Chicago leather tannery used by Nomad.
Each band is handcrafted during a six-month tanning process, sewn together with Fil Au Chinois beeswax linen thread, and finished with 316L gauge stainless steel lugs and buckle. Like other leathers, it wears over time, creating a unique look and patina through the aging process.
Nomad's custom lugs that are a bit bulkier than most that we've seen and as a result, give the Apple Watch a slightly different shape. These limited edition straps also have a unique design on the underside showing the raw finish of the Shell Cordovan leather. 
The new Shell Cordovan Apple Watch straps are available for the 42mm and 44mm Apple Watch models and come exclusively in black.
They can be purchased now from Nomad's website for $149.95.

Apple Insider,"Apple, Huawei both using 7nm TSMC processors, beating out Qualcomm and Samsung",10/02/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/02/apple-huawei-both-using-7nm-tsmc-processors-beating-out-qualcomm-and-intel,"Huawei may be the second smartphone producer to use processors made using a 7-nanometer process, following Apple's use of the A12 chip in the iPhone XS, with the designed-in-house Kirin 980 processor thought to be using the same production process as Apple. 
In an investor note received by AppleInsider anticipating the launch of four new models by Huawei later this month, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo writes some of the arrivals will adopt the Kirin 980, a processor designed by Huawei. According to Kuo, the processor will be produced by TSMC, the same chip company that manufactures Apple's A-series processors and other chips, and will take advantage of the firm's existing 7-nanometer process. 
This effectively makes Huawei the second company to include a 7nm-based processor into their smartphones, behind Apple. The use of the processors also applies pressure to the rest of the industry, which employs processors produced by older 10-nanometer methods, or larger, and it may take some time for other producers to catch up. 
The Kirin 980 uses the Cortex-A76 architecture and the Mali-G76 GPU, with both boasting performance and power efficiency improvements compared to their predecessors. The processor uses two super cores, two large cores, and four small efficiency cores, switching between different configurations depending on the required usage. The chip also includes a dual-core NPU that is intended for use with machine learning-based tasks, including face and object recognition, and image segmentation for photography. 
Qualcomm and MediaTek, two major chip producers, were reported in September to have postponed their own 7-nanometer chip launches until 2019, while UMC is thought to have shifted its investment into ""mature"" and speciality process nodes, and Globalfoundries has put its own 7-nanometer FinFET technology development on indefinite hold. 
Samsung is believed to be working on its own 7-nanometer process, in an attempt to win back orders from Apple that had transitioned away to TSMC over the last few years. Intel is several years behind in its own effort for 10nm, but promises that they will arrive in volume in 2019.
While a move to a 7-nanometer process offers speed boosts and power efficiency savings, two elements that are extremely attractive for mobile device vendors, the capital expenditures needed to shift below the 10-nanometer barrier are quite prohibitive. In one report, HiSilicon advised it was planning to spend a minimum of $300 million on a system-on-chip design using 7-nanometer technology, illustrating the potentially high costs involved in working at that level. 
Kuo writes the move to the 7-nanometer Kirin 980 helps Huawei narrow the gap between itself and Apple ""in terms of user experience,"" as well as differentiating its products from other Android-based smartphone vendors. 
The Mate 20 Porsche and Mate 20 Pro, both using the Kirin 980, will boast a tri-camera implementation on the rear using 40-megapixel, 20-megapixel, and 8-megapixel sensors, and will feature an optical-based fingerprint recognition system that works through the display glass, rather than relying on a separate designated area. The Mate 20, also using the Kirin 980 and having a tri-camera setup, will use a rear-based fingerprint reader. 
The fourth device, the Mate Max, will instead use a Qualcomm Snapdragon 636, have a fingerprint reader on the back, and a more typical dual camera system."
Apple Insider,HomeKit support rolling out for Netatmo Welcome security camera,10/02/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/02/homekit-support-rolling-out-for-netatmo-welcome-security-camera,"Netatmo is beginning to deploy HomeKit support for owners of its Welcome indoor security camera, beginning with beta testers, the company has confirmed.
Support ""will be available soon for everyone,"" a representative added in official forum comments. One Welcome owner on Reddit noted that the firmware update adds the camera and a motion/occupancy sensor to Apple's Home app, but that HomeKit doesn't integrate with Netatmo's facial recognition, which is to be expected since HomeKit doesn't currently support any kind of biometrics.
HomeKit should allow the Welcome to be integrated into complex automations, for instance triggering smartbulbs when motion is detected. Its view should appear in the Home app, and Netatmo has also promised Siri controls like ""turn on the camera"" or ""show me the Kitchen camera.""
The company originally announced HomeKit plans in August 2017, aiming to deliver support to the Welcome and Presence by the end of that year. While it did follow through on the Presence, Welcome compatibility was delayed not once but twice — the company missed a second target of March 2018.
HomeKit compatibility is still relatively rare among security cameras, offered by just a few brands. Companies like Google's Nest and Amazon's Ring are likely withholding support for competitive reasons, but another obstacle is Apple's requirement that cameras have a wired power supply. That's why the Arlo Baby is the only Arlo camera to use the technology."
Apple Insider,Apple's Wallet can now be used at some universities as an ID and dorm key,10/02/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/02/apples-wallet-can-now-be-used-as-some-universities-as-an-id-and-dorm-key,"Students at Duke University, the University of Alabama and the University of Oklahoma, students can now add their ID card to Apple Wallet and use it to pay for services at school, or unlock a dorm room door.
When a student authenticates, the ID appears on the lock screen. Following the pop-up, it will then have the user verify identity with Face ID or Touch ID, in the same fashion as an Apple Pay transaction. The technology is the same one that Apple used at the 2018 WWDC for attendee authentication. 
""iPhone and Apple Watch have brought us into a new era of mobility, helping to transform everyday experiences,"" said Jennifer Bailey, Apple's vice president of Internet Services. ""When we launched Apple Pay, we embarked on a goal to replace the physical wallet. By adding transit, loyalty cards and contactless ticketing we have expanded the capabilities of Wallet beyond payments, and we're now thrilled to be working with campuses on adding contactless student ID cards to bring customers even more easy, convenient and secure experiences.""
The launch of iOS 11 brought Core NFC, a framework that lets developers tap into iPhone's onboard NFC chip to scan NFC Data Exchange Format (NDEF) data tags. In the iPhone XS family, Background Tag Reading will automatically read NFC tags, and deliver the data it collects to the appropriate apps —which Apple notes can speed identification process at supporting universities.
The changes to Core NFC are a continuation of Apple's efforts to open up the technology for other uses. In Apple Park, Apple employees are already using iPhones and Apple Watches to unlock doors via NFC, something highlighted in the September event's opening skit. 
Johns Hopkins, Santa Clara and Temple Universities will bring the capability by the end of this school year."
Apple Insider,"Apple Pay Cash sightings in France, Germany suggest rollout imminent",10/02/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/02/apple-pay-cash-sightings-in-france-germany-suggest-rollout-imminent,"Apply Pay users in France and Germany may gain the ability to use Apple Pay Cash in the near future, with sightings of the set-up process and support pages indicating the launch of the personal payments feature likely to launch in the two countries very soon. 
Screenshots have surfaced showing invitations to set up Apple Pay Cash on an Apple Watch and an iPhone XS Max, devices owned by a french citizen. According to iPhon.fr, the user lives in France and has a local bank account already linked to Apple Pay, operating through Banque Populaire. 
The setup process doesn't appear to be completely functional, as the user noted there was a screen to enter a US-style social security number, presumably for identification purposes. 
The screenshots are not the only sign of an expansion of Apple Pay Cash, as Apple's own support pages for Germany explains the requirements for setting up Apple Pay Cash, as well as its usage. Notably, while the text is in german, the screenshots all depict transactions in english, using dollars, most likely as a stand-in before the feature's availability in the country. 
While it is believed Apple Pay Cash will expand from the United States to other markets in the near future, with markets in Europe prime candidates for the feature, there is no word on when exactly it will go live in each country. The feature was previously spotted in February, with users in Brazil, Ireland, and Spain, seeing it appear in the Messages app, despite not being available to use."
Apple Insider,"Review: New Tile Mate and Tile Pro with replaceable batteries, premium subscription plan",10/02/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/02/review-tile-introduces-upgraded-tile-mate-and-tile-pro-with-replaceable-batteries-new-premium-subscription-plan,"Tile on Tuesday released a pair of Bluetooth trackers, the Pro and updated Mate, with designs that — finally — accommodate user-replaceable batteries. AppleInsider got its hands on the products and takes them, as well as the new Tile premium subscription plan, for a spin.
The new device duo is the culmination of years of work, and for many customers fulfills a long-standing request. Tile has a tendency to iterate on past designs, which is what it has done here, but the company's latest releases appear to have tackled some oft-requested features in both hardware and software.
While form and capability have changed, function has not. Tile physically attaches to any item and pairs with an iOS or Android device via Bluetooth to monitor its location. Once activated, users can ping a Tile tracker remotely to find a lost pair of keys, for example, or locate a dropped wallet with Tile's unique crowd-sourced Community Find feature. Tracking goes both ways, as tapping Tile's button prompts a host device to sound if it's within range, useful for finding a misplaced iPhone. Tile Pro
The Tile Pro's aesthetic is similar to that of the Tile Sport. Both models have a dark exterior with metal frame wrapping around a textured plastic center. The new model clarifies the design with a thinner metal chassis that integrates nicely with its central housing.
Tile Pro will now work from 300 feet away, 50 percent farther than the Tile Sport and Tile Style. The ring volume is also louder, which makes the two most important parts of the Bluetooth tracker better than ever.
Tile has finally embraced replaceable batteries, meaning users no longer have to pick up a new model when their old one inevitably dies after a year's use. With a standard CR2032 cell-style battery inside, Tile's serviceable lifespan has greatly increased.
Another small tweak we appreciate is the integrated key ring loop. The metal around this area is thinner, and the hole itself is larger, making it easier to get the Tile on or off.
We will say that the new model feels a little lighter — cheaper — compared to the Tile Sport, though it does feel just as solid.
Compared to the Mate, Tile Pro is louder, more durable, better designed and works from farther away. Those extra features will run you $35, $10 more than the Style and Sport.Tile Mate
From the exterior, the new Mate is a spitting image of its predecessor. It is still small, thin and mostly white. The differences are quickly apparent when turning the device over to view its back, where three speaker ports and new battery access door are located.
To accommodate the replaceable battery, and possibly the louder speaker, Tile was forced to increase the size of the device. It is a hair larger in all dimensions. Though noticeable when compared side-by-side with the older Mate, the chunky size won't be a deal breaker.
The updated version of the Tile Mate now has a range of 150 feet, up 50 percent from the last generation. Like the Pro, the speaker is much louder, a plus for finding items buried in piles of clothes or stuck in the sofa. 
Tile Mate costs $5 more than the last generation, running $25 for a single unit. The price increase is more than worth it with a replaceable battery, as the tracker will last much longer than a year.Tile Premium
In the past, Tile batteries were non-replaceable, meaning the entire tracker had to be replaced on an almost yearly cycle. This recurring business model undoubtedly provided Tile with additional revenue.
With the move to replaceable batteries, Tile is looking to supplement lost profits with Tile Premium, a new subscription service that provides users with a pile of bonus features for a subscription fee of $2.99 a month or $29.99 a year.
All Tiles are covered under the subscription, which gets them two additional years of warranty protection. A limited number of free battery replacements is available for supported trackers, so you don't have to worry about picking up spares.
On the software side, subscribers get access to Smart Alerts that notify users when they leave an area without their Tile, unlimited sharing of owned Tiles and 30 days of saved location history.The best Bluetooth trackers
We've used Tiles for years, as well as other Bluetooth trackers. Tile has been hands down the most reliable out of the bunch, but it has always been hampered by a high price tag and non-replaceable batteries.
This year, Tile has solved at least one of those problems. Even though the price still trends toward the high side when compared to the rest of the market, user-replaceable batteries significantly extends the product's lifespan.
Of all the enhancements, our favorite feature isn't even exclusive to the new devices. With Siri Shortcuts, you can now ask Siri whenever you need to find your keys, remote, bag, wallet, camera or anything else that might be misplaced. With iCloud synchronization, Shortcuts works from your iPhone, iPad and even your HomePod.Rating: 3.5 out of 5Where to buy

Apple Insider,"Photography expert debunks iPhone XS 'beautygate,' details Apple's software-driven camera system",10/01/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/02/photography-expert-debunks-iphone-xs-beautygate-details-apples-software-driven-camera-system,"Sebastiaan de With, the developer behind popular manual photography app Halide, has been putting the iPhone XS camera system through its paces. In a comprehensive look into Apple's latest shooters, de With provides an overview of computational photography, and explains how noise reduction technology might generate selfie photos that appear artificially enhanced.
In the extensive deep dive, de With outlines why the new iPhone's images look so vastly different to those taken by the iPhone X, even though much of the hardware was carried over from last year. Notably, the developer offers an explanation for an alleged skin-smoothing effect that made headlines over the weekend.Computational photography is the future
Apple long ago realized that iPhone's future is not necessarily in its hardware. That is why the company generally shies away from publicizing ""tech specs"" such as processor speed or RAM, and instead focuses on real-world performance. 
The same holds true for the camera. Instead of simply cramming more pixels into its cameras each year, Apple focuses on improving existing components and, importantly, the software that drives them. As noted by de With, pure physics is quickly becoming the main obstacle as to how far Apple can take its pocket-sized camera platform. To push the art further, the company is increasingly reliant on its software making chops. 
It is this software that has made such a substantial difference for iPhone XS.
SVP of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller during last month's iPhone unveiling discussed the lengths to which the Apple-designed image signal processor (ISP) goes when processing a photo. 
With iPhone XS, the camera app starts taking photos as soon as you open the app, before a user even presses the shutter button. Once a photo is snapped, the handset gathers a series of separate images, from underexposed and overexposed frames to those captured at fast shutter speeds. An image selection process then chooses the best candidate frames and combines them together to create an incredibly high dynamic range photo while retaining detail. The process clearly has some unintended consequences.Bring the noise
To back up all that computational photography, the iPhone XS' camera app needs to take a lot of photos, very fast.
In service of this goal, the new camera favors a quicker shutter speed and higher ISO. When the shutter speed is increased, less light is captured by the sensor. To compensate for the decrease in light, the camera app increases the ISO, which decides how sensitive the sensor is to light. So less light comes in, but the camera is more sensitive to light and is able to output a properly exposed image.
However, as the ISO increases, the more noise starts to appear in the photo. That noise needs to be removed somehow, which is where Apple's Smart HDR and computational photography comes in to play.
More noise reduction leads to a slightly more smooth-looking image. This is part of the issue seen in the selfie-smoothing ""problem"" people have been reporting.
The second reason has to do with contrast.Less local contrast
Local contrast is what most people recognize as sharpness in a photo.
""Put simply, a dark or light outline adjacent to a contrasting light or a dark shape. That local contrast is what makes things look sharp,"" de With says.
When a sharpening effect is applied to a photo, no details are actually being added, but instead the light and dark edges are boosted, creating more contrast and thus the illusion that the image is now sharper.
Smart HDR on the iPhone XS and XS Max does a far better job at exposing an image, which decreases the local contrast and results in an image looking smoother than it otherwise would.Cameras for the masses
The biggest issues with this method of photography arise when shooting RAW. De With hypothesizes that the iPhone XS still prioritizes shorter exposure times and higher ISO to get the best Smart HDR photo, even when shooting RAW — which gets no benefit from Smart HDR. This leaves overexposed and sometimes blown out photos with details being clipped and unreclaimable.
RAW shots don't get noise reduction applied either, and with the added noise from the higher ISO, this makes for extremely poor looking images. This means when shooting RAW, you must shoot in manual and purposefully underexpose the image.
Apple's apparent camera app decisions affect third-party apps — such as Halide — which is why de With says they have been working on an upcoming feature called Smart RAW. It uses a bit of their own computational magic to get more detail out of RAW photos while reducing noise. This new feature will be included in a forthcoming update to Halide.
While a lot of the analysis sounds critical, issues experienced at the hand of Apple's algorithms are so far outliers. Most selfies are taken in very unflattering light, and without the changes Apple has made, they would be poorly exposed and full of noise. Apple has likely erred on the side of caution by over-removing the noise and creating too-smooth images, but this can be pulled back.
More importantly, Apple has the ability to tinker with its firmware to solve the problems through subsequent updates if it so chooses. 
As we saw in our recent iPhone XS vs X photo comparison, the iPhone XS and XS Max with Smart HDR have significantly improved photo taking capabilities, and the vast majority of users are already seeing the benefits."
Apple Insider,"Tests show iPhone XS LTE speeds best iPhone X, can't match Galaxy Note 9 or Pixel 2",10/01/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/01/tests-show-iphone-xs-lte-speeds-best-iphone-x-cant-match-galaxy-note-9-or-pixel-2,"Though a handful of early iPhone XS adopters are complaining about less-than-desirable cellular reception, a new test reveals Apple's latest flagship smartphones boast much improved LTE performance over last year's model. However, the XS models, which rely on Intel modems, are still behind handsets that use battle-tested Qualcomm silicon. 
Conducted by PCMag in partnership with Cellular Insights, the evaluation pitted iPhone XS and XS Max against top industry performers including Samsung's Galaxy Note 9 and Google's Pixel 2. Last year's Intel-powered iPhone X, using the chipmaker's XMM7480 modem, was also included for reference. 
For 2018, Apple opted to ditch Qualcomm in favor of Intel's next-generation XMM7560, an LTE modem capable of communicating with networks run by the four major U.S. wireless carriers. The latest iPhones are also the first to sport 4x4 MIMO antennas, boosting top-end speed and enhancing performance in areas where cell signals are weak.
Testing involved creating a 20MHz channel of Band 4, employed by AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and major Canadian carriers, with Rohde & Schwarz equipment capable of supporting 4x4 MIMO configurations. Cellular Insights attenuated an LTE signal from -85 dBm, a strong signal, and slowly decreased reference power until the phones ceased to download data.
Overall, iPhone XS Max performed nearly on par with the Galaxy Note 9 and Pixel 2, both of which sport Qualcomm modems in the X20 and X16, respectively. At -85 dBm, all three smartphones achieved nearly 400 Mbps download speeds. The XS exhibited a precipitous drop in performance at -86dBm, while the Pixel 2 and Note 9 saw nearly identical dips at -89 dBm and -90 dBm, respectively.
Apple's phone stopped receiving data at -128 dBm, while the Note 9 ceased reception at around -131 dBm. Interestingly, the Pixel 2's X16 modem continued to function beyond the measured range, though performance degraded to approximately 10 Mbps. 
As can be expected from two nearly identical smartphones, Apple's XS and XS Max put in largely similar performances. The larger iPhone XS Max pulled ahead at certain signal levels, but the slight deviation would go unnoticed in a real-world scenario, the publication said. 
Apple's latest iPhone, while trailing a bit behind competitors using Qualcomm modems, is markedly improved compared to it predecessor. Lab testing saw the iPhone XS Max handily outperform the iPhone X at all signal levels, nearly doubling the 2017 iPhone under good conditions. The gains are primarily attributed to 4x4 MIMO antennas, though fine tuning of Intel's new XMM chip seemingly helped iPhone XS Max perform with relatively weak signals. 
Real-world testing bore similar results, with iPhone XS Max seeing an average download speed increase of 6.6Mbps on all U.S. carriers, according to statistics provided by speedtest specialist Ookla. AT&T was most improved with an 8Mbps bump in performance. In Canada, overall download average deltas jumped to 20.2Mbps, with Telus being the network most greatly benefitted from the changes Apple made this year. 
Comparatively, Samsung's Note 9 displayed average LTE download speeds of 43.2Mbps during the week of Sept. 24, while iPhone speeds averaged 38.9Mbps for the same period. Again, download figures massively improved in Canada, where the Note 9 averaged speeds of 97.7Mbps to XS Max's 85.4Mbps, the study found.
Finally, the publication notes a bump in iPhone X performance when upgrading from iOS 11 to iOS 12. Notably, download speeds on an iPhone X running iOS 12 neared performance levels seen by Qualcomm versions of the device running iOS 11.
The test results arrive roughly one week after early iPhone XS and XS Max customers began to complain of poor cellular and Wi-Fi reception. Today's findings — lab tests in particular —
suggest Apple's hardware is not to blame, leaving hope that a firmware update will solve the sporadic issue."
Apple Insider,"Apple's Greg Joswiak argues most people will keep iOS 12's Screen Time on, change behavior",10/01/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/01/apples-greg-joswiak-argues-most-people-will-keep-ios-12s-screen-time-on-change-behavior,"Screen Time, one of the key additions in iOS 12, is meant to give people access to data that can influence their behavior without imposing hard limits, Apple marketing VP Greg Joswiak said in a recent podcast interview.
""If you ask people how much they're using their devices, they can only guess,"" Joswiak told Arianna Huffington on ""The Thrive Global Podcast."" 
""If you ask them how much they're using a particular app or category of app, they can only guess,"" he continued. ""I almost guarantee you their guesses are wrong. So what we wanted to do was provide people with the real information about how much they're using devices, apps, categories of apps, and how many notifications they're getting. These things are very measurable.""
The executive said he believes most people will turn Screen Time on, and control how they use iPhones and iPads as a result.
""For me, I couldn't imagine leaving my home in the morning without my iPhone. I think like most people,"" Joswiak commented. ""I still found it fascinating to be able to open up the Screen Time app and see where I was spending my time... That information was useful for me to regulate myself to the behavior that I want. I didn't need limits, I just needed that information.""
One of the features of Screen Time is the ability for parents to monitor their children and impose restrictions, but Joswiak suggested that parents will be able to have an ""intelligent conversation"" about usage before resorting to harsh rules.
Screen Time should continue to evolve in future updates. ""We know there's lots more we'll want to do over time,"" Joswiak hinted."

All of them, though, require some form of live TV service. Specifically you need a package with FS1, Fox, and/or TBS — that includes most U.S. cable and satellite providers. Many if not all of them will let you authenticate with Fox Sports Go and Watch TBS, both of which support the iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV. Note that you'll want Fox specifically for the World Series.
You can also go through MLB.tv, but that still requires authenticating a provider on top of a $24.99 postseason fee, so only diehards need apply.
If you're a cord-cutter, you're in luck. Several internet TV streamers with iOS and tvOS apps are offering the needed channels, including Sling TV, PlayStation Vue, Hulu, DirecTV Now, and YouTube TV. 
Sling's Blue package is your best bet if you're planning to pay — it includes FS1, Fox, and TBS for $25 per month."
Apple Insider,Apple highlights iPhone XS camera quality in new 'Shot on iPhone' images,10/01/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/01/apple-highlights-iphone-xs-camera-quality-in-new-shot-on-iphone-images,"Apple is continuing to promote the dual camera system included with the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, by featuring a number of photographs taken by the new generation of iPhones that have been shared on social media. 
Apple's public relations team has selected images posted to Twitter and Instagram that highlight the quality and the new capabilities of the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max. All of the images were pulled from social media posts that used the tag #ShotoniPhone. 
The images cover a wide variety of different styles and subjects, ranging from cityscapes to nature, from action shots to still life images, and some featuring animals. 
The camera quality has been a major feature of the iPhones over the years, and has certainly helped contribute to its high sales. Among the improvements in the new models include larger pixels in the sensors, a faster processor, an upgraded Neural Engine for facial recognition and image segmentation, Smart HDR, and an updated Portrait Mode that simulates the aperture in editing to increase or decrease the bokeh effect. 
Apple has promoted the iPhone XS and XS Max cameras by highlighting shots by professional photographers after the September launch of the new models. The first ""Shot on iPhone"" feature showed two photographers experimenting with the Slo-mo and Time-lapse functions, while still images from other photographers were shared a few days later. 
Following the release, Apple CEO Tim Cook took to Twitter to share some of the initial shots taken on the new iPhones."
Apple Insider,"Steve Wozniak's 'Woz U' boot camp accused of shoddy courses, heavy-handed sales tactics",10/01/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/01/steve-wozniaks-woz-u-boot-camp-accused-of-shoddy-courses-heavy-handed-sales-tactics,"Though associated with one of the famous co-founders of Apple, Steve Wozniak's ""Woz U"" programming boot camp has over-promised and under-delivered, a report charged on Monday.
Electronic course material is riddled with typos that can prevent code from working, according to CBS News, which spoke with over two dozen current and former students and faculty. Text is often said to link to Wikipedia or Microsoft documents, and ""live lectures"" have turned out to be pre-recorded and outdated.
Worse, student mentors are allegedly unqualified, and at least one course has gone without an instructor.
A former enrollment counselor, Tim Mionske, told CBS that Woz U put heavy pressure on him and his peers to recruit new students, taking advantage of Wozniak's celebrity. Following the school's fall 2017 launch the number of recruiters is said to have jumped from 16 to 60, while management simultaneously increased the pressure such that staff were supposedly forced to ignore concerns if they wanted to keep their jobs. Mionske was laid off in June 2018.
A student that spoke to CBS, Bill Duerr, separately told AppleInsider he'd heard Woz U was cold-calling recently-separated veterans, which made him angry on top of the problems with courses.
""I feel like this is a $13,000 e-book,"" Duerr said to CBS. In all he paid $13,200 for a 33-week program, including over $7,000 in student loans.CBS confronted Wozniak at a conference in Miami, but he deflected the issue.
""I've had some calls, but here's the trouble, I'm in the busy part of a speaker's life,"" Wozniak said. A woman at the conference called for security, and Wozniak accused correspondent Tony Dokoupil of making statements and pretending they're questions before walking away.
Woz U President Chris Coleman has acknowledged mistakes in course material, and said a system is now in place to catch them, including reviews by Wozniak. Coleman denied any high-pressure sales tactics."
Apple Insider,"Apple may face even higher iPhone taxes, import restrictions in India market",10/01/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/01/apple-may-face-even-higher-iphone-taxes-import-restrictions-in-india-market,"Apple may face tougher trading conditions in India in the future, after a top advisor to Prime Minister Narendra Modi insisted the country should restrict its import of luxury goods like the iPhone and tax them heavily, instead of raising interest rates to bolster the rupee. 
In an interview, the Economic Advisory Council member Rathin Roy insisted the government needs to make it less appealing for the country's citizens to enjoy luxury goods, reports Bloomberg. ""We need to actively send signals to disincentivize or discourage increase in consumption of what I describe as explicit luxuries,"" the adviser proclaimed. 
These explicit luxuries include the iPhone, which Roy noted had seen increases in imports to India in recent times. As another example of luxury-based spending, Roy suggested the expenditure on overseas education and other services have also increased. 
Roy's comments follow after an announcement by India's government on Wednesday that it had raised import taxes on a variety of goods, including jewelry and footwear, by $12 billion. The iPhone and similar goods have a good chance of being hit by future import tax rises, as electronics and gold are the country's biggest imports behind oil. 
The four-year high of Oil is said to be making global funds nervous, groups who pulled $2.45 billion from local bonds and stocks in September 2017. Those withdrawals are claimed to have helped reduce the value of the rupee to record lows, making it the worst-performing currency in Asia according to economists. 
A Bloomberg survey of economists reveals most would call for a 25-basis-point rate hike by the central bank, but Roy dismisses this, suggesting it isn't the right answer to fix the currency's poor situation. The government has also fought off attempts to short the currency, with measures to improve cash availability with banks forming part of the countermeasures. 
The luxury goods rate increases would follow a similar path taken by Indonesia, another country with a current-account deficit. In Indonesia's case, the country took the opportunity to delay ""import-heavy infrastructure projects"" as well as increasing taxes on luxury goods imports. 
While Roy's advice will be heard by Prime Minister Modi, it remains to be seen if it will be adopted by the country in the coming months as it tries to rectify the rupee. If India adopts the recommendation, Apple's existing efforts to increase sales in the country may be hampered. 
Apple is currently awaiting permission to open full corporate-run retail outlets in the country, and has looked into opening premium franchise-owned outlets as a temporary measure. It may also be able to counter some of the import tax rises by expanding its existing iPhone production operations with assembly partner Wistron, which it uses to make the iPhone 6s for local sale. 
Apple lost three local executives earlier this year, which the company replaced in August with a new head of operations. Michel Coulomb is reportedly pursuing an aggressive strategy to resuscitate iPhone sales, which have apparently dwindled to just 1 percent of the market. 
A fight with the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is an even bigger threat to its efforts, with a potential ban of iPhones from the country's mobile networks on the cards if the company does not comply with laws mandating the installation of an official anti-spam app. It is expected that Apple and the regulator will be going to court over the matter."
Apple Insider,Photo shootout — Comparing the iPhone XS Max versus the iPhone X,10/01/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/01/photo-shootout----comparing-the-iphone-xs-max-versus-the-iphone-x,"Among all the changes in iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max versus the iPhone X, the camera saw the most detail work from Apple, with changes like a new sensor on the iPhone XS Max, a brand new depth control feature, and a new Smart HDR feature which is one of the biggest improvements.
We decided to take our iPhone XS Max and iPhone X to Couer d'Alene, Idaho and snap some photos to see how much the camera actually improved.High Dynamic Range Comparison
Starting off with a selfie photo in harsh lighting conditions, both phones fared well. The iPhone XS Max did have better dynamic range. Some of the color in the sky is washed out on the iPhone X.
Taking a closer look, there's more detail with the iPhone XS Max as well.
Shooting against the sun, the iPhone XS Max does much better in terms of dynamic range. It's also able to bring more color into the photo.
In a portrait mode photo against the sun, the subject's face on the iPhone X image is extremely underexposed. On the iPhone XS Max, there is clearly more detail of not just the subject, but the surroundings.
Both phones do a great job with dynamic range and sharpness. Interestingly, the iPhone XS Max wide lens has a wider field of view than the one on the iPhone X, given the same distance from the subject, and same zoom.
In this photo, we also see some pretty major improvements in dynamic range. The arms have a more linear exposure on the iPhone XS Max, even though the exposure of the background is the same with both phones.Portrait mode and depth control
With the new depth control feature on the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, we can now adjust the depth of the background. This also adjusts bokeh as well, which we'll show you a bit later.
The default setting is F4.5, but turning it up to F2.8 makes a decent improvement in blur. F1.4 is the maximum and it really makes the photo stand out compared to the photo array taken on the iPhone X.
Apple's new depth control feature has an extremely wide range of adjustment from F16 to F1.4. This is much wider in practice, compared to other phones like the Samsung Galaxy Note 9, which can only go from its own zero to seven scale in terms of background blur, which we're guessing is about F10 to F2.0.
Even images of objects like a wooden post can look better when the blur is turned up on the XS Max. Here's the maximum distance at which you can snap a portrait mode photo. 
There is also a massive difference in dynamic range. The background on the iPhone X is extremely overexposed. The iPhone XS Max easily keeps the photo balanced and maintains all of the detail.
The shots we took are very near to the minimum range at which you can take a portrait photo —and is uncomfortably close. 
Selfie portrait mode photos look great on both the iPhone X and iPhone XS Max, with the iPhone XS Max delivering more detail. You can adjust the depth on selfie portrait photos as well, which is something you can't do on other phones like the Galaxy Note 9.
With low-light portrait photography, much more color comes through on the XS Max. Even though the iPhone XS Max white balance is cooler compared to the iPhone X, the bokeh on the iPhone XS Max is warmer, closer to how it actually looks.Autofocus auto-exposure speed comparison
We noticed that the iPhone X had drastic exposure changes while the iPhone XS Max adjustments were very smooth, and hunted for the optimal pointless. Not only that, but the dynamic range on the XS Max was many times better than the iPhone X during this test.Photo detail comparison
While shooting some up-close photos of plants and flowers, the detail looked similar on both phones. However, the iPhone XS Max images seemed to be more balanced and a bit flat compared to the iPhone X photos, which had more contrast which made them look more detailed.
In a close-up shot of a tree, the iPhone XS Max had extremely accurate white balance, where the iPhone X's photo looked too cool. We also noticed much more detail with the iPhone XS Max as well.
In wider detail shots, the XS Max produced more vibrant colors on flowers and in the sky, while maintaining the great dynamic range.
With the telephoto lens, there were significant improvements in detail as well. The XS Max continued to bring out more color in the sky and plants than the iPhone X was able to. 
With a regular selfie photo, both phones did great in dynamic range, but the iPhone XS Max had much more detail in the face, so we can see that detail was improved all around.Low-light photo comparison
Moving indoors, we see an even bigger difference in dynamic range. As you can see in this photo, the lamp and the painting are extremely blown out on the iPhone X. Not only that, but the iPhone X is applying far more softening to the image than the iPhone XS Max, which you can see on the pants.
The iPhone XS Max is showing incredibly great dynamic range, and you can see every little detail on the painting.
An even bigger difference in dynamic range was demonstrated in a dark environment with very bright lights at a distance. The iPhone XS Max's photo was more balanced overall and you could see more color and detail in the background.
We found the darkest spot we could find and snapped a photo. There was noticeably less noise on the iPhone XS Max's image, and it has much more detail. We can also see how much wider the wide lens is on the iPhone XS Max than the iPhone X.
Later on in the evening, we snapped a photo of the night sky with buildings and bright lights in the foreground. The iPhone XS Max did better in terms of dynamic range, but we're still not completely happy with it.
Finally, we snapped a low light portrait photo in the office to compare blur. The colors of the bokeh on the iPhone XS Max were true to life and the tree was properly exposed. After adjusting the depth on the iPhone XS Max to F1.4, the bokeh looks even better.
You can easily tell how Apple is warping and rotating the bokeh balls depending on location in the frame. However, one downside to increasing the background blur is that any issues with blur edging become more noticeable.The best iPhone camera yet 
Overall, we're extremely impressed with the camera changes that Apple put into the XS & XS Max, after not originally expecting much in the way of differences in performance. Given this performance increase, upgraders coming from an iPhone 6S or iPhone 7 Plus —the market Apple appears to be shooting for the most —will see a monumental increase.Deals on the iPhone X, XS and XS Max

Apple Insider,Inside macOS Mojave: How to use Apple's new Screenshots feature,10/01/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/01/inside-macos-mojave-how-to-use-apples-new-screenshots-feature,"It seemed like just a slightly better way to grab an image of your Mac screen but Apple's new Screenshots feature is far more powerful than that. AppleInsider digs into the details.
There is one feature in macOS Mojave which you can't find through a menu, you have to know the keyboard shortcut. If you're a long-time Mac user, though, you're well on your way to using this new Screenshot feature because it's an evolution of what we've had before.
Where you can press Command-Shift-3 to take a full-screen shot or Command-Shift-4 to take a portion of the screen, now you can do Command-Shift-5. This doesn't take an image quite the way the other two do: it first presents you with small strip of tools for taking images.
It's all very neatly done but behind the neatness hides a plethora of options and they're not all obvious.The control strip
The strip appears toward the bottom middle of your screen. Apart from a small cancel X to the left, the strip is divided into either three or usually four sections. 
The first section has three icons to do with taking a still image of your Mac's screen.  From left to right they are buttons for taking a shot of your entire display, just one selected window on it, or some other portion you decide. 
Choose the middle one for taking a selected window and the strip shrinks from four to three sections. The fourth is labelled Capture and it's one way you can tell your Mac you're ready to take the shot.
As it happens, though, if you click on any of the first three buttons and then click again away from the control strip, it takes the shot immediately anyway. That's an option when you're taking a shot of the whole or a portion of the screen, it's the sole way to take the shot of a window.
Very, very nicely, that one where it takes an image of a particular window on your display does so whether you can actually see all of the window or not. So long as there is a portion visible, clicking in there will take a shot of the whole window as if nothing were in front of it.
That also happens if you take the slightly longer route. Rather than click once on the button and then click away from the strip, you can select the button you want and now choose from other controls too.Options and preferences
If you've selected one of the three still image buttons, then the section toward the right of the strip marked Options contains display preferences, a timer and also a destination.
Previously whatever way you took a screenshot on your Mac, the image file was saved to the desktop. That's the default here too but you can instead choose to skip saving it and send the image to someone over email or Messages. You can elect to have Preview open the image directly or you can have it save to anywhere on your Mac.
The timer section is an excellent touch. If you ever have to show someone which menu option to choose in Excel then this is how you do it: you set the timer for 5 or 10 seconds and then click through to the menu you want to show. Time it right and you're in position when the timer goes off and the shot is taken.
One of the remaining choices in this Options section is to have your mouse pointer be shown. Typically it isn't, the pointer is invisible so that it doesn't spoil the shot but when you want someone to be really clear which menu option or which tick box you're telling them about, this can help.
There are then also options for Show Floating Thumbnail and Remember Last Selection, both of which are on by default. 
You'll recognise the floating thumbnail: this is iOS 12's screenshot feature brought to the Mac. Unless you switch this off, as soon as you've taken any shot, it appears for a few seconds as a small window at bottom right of your display. You can click on that to edit it or just ignore it, knowing that the image will be saved for you.
Remember Last Selection is also a smart touch. If you drag the cursor across the screen to take a shot of a specific part of it, Mojave's Screenshot feature remembers where you did it. That means next time it will default to doing the same thing.
And that means you can end up with a series of shots that are all exactly the same size and composition. It saves you editing time in Photoshop or Pixelmator Pro later.Video
The next section along from the three buttons for taking still images is concerned with video. Here you only get two buttons: one for recording the whole screen and one for just a particular portion of it that you then define.
Once you click on either of these video buttons, the Capture button at the end of the strip changes to Record. More significantly, the Options section changes.
You get all the same timer controls, options for where to save the file and whether to have a floating thumbnail afterwards. However, you also get a new section about audio. Every possible sound input connected to your Mac is displayed here and you can choose any —or none.
If you want to record yourself talking through how you apply grading to a movie in Final Cut Pro, this is how you do it.
You don't have the same freedom to set controls and then click away from the strip to start recording as you can with the still image screenshots. With video, you have to make your choice and then click on the Record button.
Once you do that, it obviously starts recording but the very first time you do it, you get a notification of how to stop it, too. 
One tip we'd give you is to wait a moment before you start either speaking or doing anything on your Mac. It depends on your hardware but it can take a couple of seconds before Screenshots is capturing the video.
You can check that it got the start of what you were trying to do by clicking on the Floating Thumbnail that appears after you stop recording. Click on that and it springs up into a larger window that includes a scrub bar for moving back and forth through it.
In a similar way to the old QuickTime Player, which still exists in macOS Mojave, you can also do some light editing on the video. You can trim the start or end of it to get it to be featuring only what you want.It's very nice, but...
If you'd like to mess with your own head, use this feature to make a video of your screen —and then while that's recording, use the same thing to take a screen shot.
Mojave's new Screenshot feature is just remarkably powerful and feature-packed. It will stop some people needing to buy apps like Screenflow, but then it will also show some other people why you'd want that other software.
If there are any alternatives to Apple's own tools for taking actual screen shots, then we neither know nor care. What we do know and care about enormously is that there have long been tools for taking videos or screencasts of your Mac.
They do still offer more. Screenflow, for instance, has the ability to easily zoom in or out of a video. So say you want to show someone a tiny icon in the middle of a Mac app's window: Screenflow lets you zoom in and highlight it.
Really apps like Screenflow have moved on to become fuller-featured video editing tools. 
If you just need to grab a single shot or show someone a simple video, though, macOS Mojave is now your best option.Keep up with AppleInsider by downloading the AppleInsider app for iOS, and follow us on YouTube, Twitter @appleinsider and Facebook for live, late-breaking coverage.

Apple Insider,Verizon 5G Home internet service goes live with free Apple TV offer,10/01/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/01/verizon-5g-home-internet-service-goes-live-with-free-apple-tv-offer,"Verizon has launched its 5G Home Internet service in four cities, competing against normal home broadband with a cellular-based version boasting connection speeds of up to 300Mbps, with an Apple TV 4K offered to tempt customers to sign up to the service. 
As previously announced by the carrier, Verizon's 5G Home service has gone live in four markets, with limited areas of Sacramento and Los Angeles, CA; Houston, TX; and Indianapolis, IN. able to sign up for in the initial rollout. 
Verizon is offering three months for free, then the service will cost $50 per month for existing Verizon subscribers, $70 for everyone else.
Running on Verizon's ""proprietary 5G standard,"" 5G Home is similar to a typical home broadband service, with Internet access provided via a single router, albeit one that uses the carrier's cellular network instead of a physical connection. Speeds of around 300 megabits per second are touted, rising to nearly gigabit speeds in some areas, seemingly with no data caps. 
To sweeten the deal for early adopters, customers can request either a free Apple TV 4K or Chromecast Ultra, provided at the time of installation, as well as three free months of YouTube TV access. Those signing up are also to receive ""white glove installation"" of the service, a 24-hour concierge line, access to the first wave of 5G-capable mobile devices when they become available, and free hardware upgrades when they become available in the first year. 
The latter point is likely to be very beneficial to customers, as Verizon is using its own version of 5G for the service, rather than an industry standard variant. As the iteration used will only communicate with specialized devices, in this case 5G Home routers, when the company migrates to standard 3GPP 5G NR technology for future installations in new areas, hardware upgrades are likely to be offered to the earlier customers. 
The rollout of the service will also help Verizon in expanding its 5G network in general, which will provide high-speed connectivity for future smartphones and other mobile devices. While Verizon does claim the title as the first of the U.S. operators to produce a commercial 5G network with their 5G Home product, it is likely that subscribers will have to wait until 2019 before they can receive the same speed benefits from their smartphones."

The company is running 108 teaching sessions in all with the help of professional illustrators. Only eight flagship Apple stores will be participating however, namely Union Square in San Francisco, Michigan Avenue in Chicago, Regent Street in London, Piazza Liberty in Milan, Singapore's Orchard Road, Dubai Mall, plus the Williamsburg and SoHo stores in New York City.
Some unique sessions will include an emoji chalk mural by kids, done outside the Michigan Avenue store, and a screening of the film ""Last Day of Freedom"" at Union Square.
All sessions will be free, but with attendance capped by space."
Apple Insider,How to create your own Dynamic Desktops in macOS Mojave,10/01/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/01/how-to-create-your-own-dynamic-desktops-in-macos-mojave,"Apple only provides two desktop images that change throughout the day but you can make your own with some photography, image editing and a little workaround. AppleInsider gets to work.
Doubtlessly, Apple is going to add more Dynamic Desktops to macOS and at the very least we'll surely see some more when next year's update comes around. In the meantime, however, you can create your own equivalent to the two Apple provides. You can have any desktop image that changes to match the time of day by planning ahead and preparing some photographs.
The two images that Apple includes are examples of rather opposite possibilities. One is a photo of the Mojave desert and the other is Solar Gradients, a generated image whose hues and colors alter throughout the day. 
You can do both and the steps are almost the same. What you won't get
There is something you can't match. Apple's Dynamic Desktop does change throughout the day but it's also location-aware. Your Mac knows where you are and it knows what the typical light levels are there for any time in the year. The Dynamic Desktop you see at 15:00 on July 1 is not going to be the same one you'll see at 15:00 on December 1. 
It's not as if Apple's desktops can yet adapt to the local weather conditions but they do automatically alter according to the seasons and specifically the seasons where you are. 
Also, images in Apple's Dynamic Desktops are not JPEG like the rest of the Mac's default desktop photos, they're HEIC. This format lets you have a single image that contains multiple others.
You can obviously see all of Apple's images in Settings, Desktop & Screen Saver, but take a look in the Finder, instead. Click on the Go menu, choose Go to Folder and then type: /Library/Desktop Pictures.
The number of images you'll see will be different depending on how many of your own shots you've already used as desktops. However, the majority will be Apple's ones and you'll see that they are all JPEG and around 10MB. 
Except for Solar Gradients which is 80.9MB HEIC and Mojave which is 134.8MB and also HEIC. (There are also two separate Mojave shots called Day and Night which are from the same set but broken out into individual non-dynamic images. They're 7.2MB and 9MB JPEG.)
Drag Mojave.heic to Preview and it will open up as one document with 16 images in. It's actually one HEIC image containing 16 TIFF format ones.
Even knowing how many shots there are and in what format, you can't replicate Apple's official Dynamic Desktop images. You can create your own images and save them as HEIC format, but there's no point. Even if you copy them into the same folder as Apple's Mojave and Solar Gradient images, the Mac ignores them.
Equally, as you'll see, you can make any image a desktop wallpaper one and that includes any HEIC photos you've got. Except the Mac will only display one image, it won't cycle.
So the only true way to get a Dynamic Desktop is to use Apple's —however, you can mimic the effect very closely.Start with photography
Take a series of photos from the same point over a single day. We'll tell you now that there's no point taking 16: instead take 12 because later you'll be using them one per hour. We'll also tell you that it's a bit of a pain making sure the shots are from exactly the same angle.
You could get a tripod and rig up some kind of timing mechanism, or you could wing it and figure it's close enough. We won't judge if you don't.
When you've got the images, save them to a folder on their own and then rename each one. Instead of whatever your camera or iPhone named them, call each by the time you took it. There's no need to be to to the second: we just called them 0900, 1200 and so on. Make sure you only use numbers, not colon separators. So 1000, not 10:00.
What this does is arrange your photos in that folder into the order they should appear throughout the day. Your original names probably do the same but you'll find it harder to pick out IMG_2938.PNG than you will 0800.PNG.Set it up
Go to System Preferences, Desktop & Screen Saver. There's a column on the far left which shows the names of folders that contain images. If you've not added any yourself, then you'll just see one folder called Apple with subfolders such as Nature, Plants and so on.
At the foot of this list there is a plus and minus sign. This is where you add new images to the list of ones your Mac can use as a desktop. However, you can't actually add an image per se: you have to add a folder. Click on the plus and a standard Open dialog appears.
Go through that to either pick the folder with your images or click through to select one shot. Whichever you do, macOS brings the whole folder in.
You'll now see that folder listed: click on it to see a thumbnail of all of your images. They won't be named. To see which is 0900, for instance, click on one of the thumbnails and the image at the top changes. This is the image that represents your current desktop so doing this does change that to whichever shot you've just clicked on. However, to the right of that now current image, you'll see the 0900 or whichever.
Pick the one that is closes to the current time of day when you're doing this. Then when that's highlighted, an option called Change picture becomes active underneath. Click to switch that on and then click on the dropdown menu next to it.
This has options for how often the picture changes. Remember that 'none' is not an option: to have one desktop image that doesn't change, you need to untick the Change picture option entirely.
For our purposes, the option to choose from the dropdown is Every hour.
Click on that and you are done. Throughout the day, your desktop will cycle through your 12 photographs - and it will do it in order. So the image at 18:00 will be the shot you've labelled 1800.
Actually, there is an argument to do 24 shots if you have the patience. For say you can't sleep and you decide to switch on your Mac at 03:00. Where your room is pitch dark, your Mac screen will be showing the potentially blinding 1500 desktop.Color images
If you can't face staying up for 24 hours taking a shot every sixty minutes, you can mimic Apple's other Dynamic Desktop, the Solar Gradients.
This is effective a series of color images, specifically blue, which gets brighter and darker as the day goes by. You can have that or any color desktop you like so long as you prepare the images.
And there is a quick way to do that too.
You start with a single image of the right size. This size depends on your Mac but so that you at least get the proportions correct, drag one of the existing desktops out of /Library/Desktop Pictures and into an image editor.
We're using Pixelmator Pro but the regular Pixelmator can do this and so canPhotoshop or Affinity Photo. 
Save that desktop image under a new name somewhere and the paint over it in any color you want. We've done a straight blue wash but you could create patterns, you could do absolutely anything.
That's because the trick of this one is that you're not then going to alter that image at all. Or rather, you're not going to alter anything you've painted: instead, you're going to cover it up.
Create a new layer and paint it completely black. Make sure you have selected the new layer first and then move it to the top of the stack. You should be left seeing only the completely black image.
Now in Pixelmator Pro, choose the Style icon and a set of options appears. At the very top there will be a slider labelled Opacity (Normal) and the number 100%. 
It's a similar thing in all image editors. Create a new layer at the top, paint it black, then alter the opacity of it.How black is black
Export that image in PNG format and call it 100. As before, make sure you save it to a folder that you're only going to use for this purpose.
Then you can see what's next: we're going to alter the opacity of the black layer. This is like a gauze over your actual desktop image: the greater the opacity, the darker your image appears. And as we reduce the opacity, the lighter that image appears.
Change the opacity to 90 percent and then export a PNG you call 90. And 80. And so on.
Really, what we'd like to end up with is 12 images of increasing darkness but the math troubles us. If you divide 100 into 12 you get that you have to do each new image with 8.3 per cent more opacity.
For speed and sanity, we just did it at 10 per cent intervals instead. That did mean we ended up with 10 images instead of 12 but we duplicated the first and last.Same old, same old
Now you just open System Preferences, Desktop & Screen Saver and click on the plus sign to import all these images.
This time you choose the one that looks best to you right now and then click on Change picture. Choose Every hour and your Mac will cycle through each of them hourly. There is a problem
You have just duplicated Apple's Dynamic Desktop feature with your own images or your own colors. From now on, your Mac will automatically change the desktop every hour throughout the day.
Or rather, it will in theory. In practice, we've found some inconsistencies. It does definitely change and you will definitely see the progression. However, don't expect it to happen exactly on the hour.
It should and so very often it does, yet at times we have had odd results. We tried this with a clock face that we built up over five-minute increments —instead of changing the picture Every hour, we chose Every 5 minutes —and it simply didn't work.
The Mac did change but just whenever it got around to it, not even close to the five minute mark. We suspect the age of the Mac was a factor and so were things such as when we put it to sleep or when we had it under heavy load such as rendering Final Cut Pro X videos.
At worst, though, you get an image that changes sporadically and at best it follows much the same pattern as Apple's Dynamic Desktop.

Apple Insider,Apple Music & Jimmy Kimmel Live partner for 'Up Next' performances & promotion,10/01/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/01/apple-music-jimmy-kimmel-live-partner-for-up-next-performances-promotion,"Apple is reportedly partnering with the ABC show ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" for Apple Music's second wave of ""Up Next"" promotions for emerging artists.
Artists will not only get to perform on ""Jimmy Kimmel,"" but get a ""custom content package,"" including a live EP, an on-camera Beats 1 interview, and inclusion in audio and video playlists for new artists, Variety said on Monday. The first group to benefit from the marketing will be the all-boy Korean pop-dance band NCT 127, performing on Oct. 8.
To date Apple has used Up Next to promote one act per month within Apple Music, sometimes pushing video to Twitter and YouTube. Some featured artists have included 6LACK, Amy Shark, and Greta Van Fleet, and a few musicians like 6LACK have appeared on ""The Late Late Show with James Corden.""
Apple has close ties with Corden, since the show ""Carpool Karaoke"" is a spinoff of a ""Late Late Show"" segment. The Apple series recently picked up an Outstanding Short Form Variety Series award at the Creative Arts Emmys.
The company regularly tries to straddle the gap between mainstream and independent music. It needs the former for financial reasons and cachet, and the latter for catering to different niches.
""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" has upwards of 2 million viewers each week. Apple Music is believed to have about 21 million North American subscribers, out of some 45 million worldwide."
Apple Insider,Kanye West makes bizarre claim about the 'YZY' brand being part of Apple,10/01/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/01/kanye-west-makes-bizarre-claim-about-the-yzy-brand-being-part-of-apple,"In a series of seemingly unprompted Tweets, Kanye West calls Steve Jobs a hero and claims his for-profit firm is actually a non-profit arm of Apple. 
Rapper and fashion designer Kanye West has spontaneously tweeted a series of comments declaring that his clothing company YZY is effectively owned by Apple. But, it is not. 
""YZY Is a for purpose (non profit) arm (branch) of Apple,"" he tweeted on September 30. ""We unofficially work for Steve Johnny Tim and Lorraine. Everything we do at YZY is to be an arm (branch) of what our hero Steve has created. With love.""
Spelling mistakes aside, he's referring to Steve Jobs, Jony Ive and Tim Cook. We can only guess that by ""Lorraine"" he means Laurene Powell Jobs, the businesswoman and widow of Steve Jobs. 
West attempted to clarify matters a few minutes later by adding: ""We also work for Eddie Q and all 123 thousand {Apple} crew members."" Next to Eddy Cue's name, West placed a crying-with-laughter emoji. 
We think West may then have wanted to be a little clearer that this bond with Apple was less contractual, more spiritual as he also said: ""I will never be Steve. I will always be YE. We are here in service to Steve's vision. Let's make the planet {Apple} level.""
Apple has yet to respond to requests for comment. However, according to AppleInsider sources inside Apple who are not authorized to speak on the record, there is a great deal of amusement inside Apple Park about the suggestion that YZY is somehow affiliated with the iPhone maker in any way.YE Forever
He may well ""be Ye forever"" but he'd only been it for one day a the time of the proclamation. West tweeted ""the being formally known as Kanye West I am YE"" on September 29. 
At the time he tweeted that, he would have been in rehearsals at ""Saturday Night Live"" where he performed as the season 44 opener's musical guest. YE Olde History with Apple
Ye aka Kanye West may now be an Apple fan but previously he has had different views. He did boast in 2016 that his wife Kim Kardashian's Kimoji app ""just shut down the app store, uh! And we made a million a minute."" 
Kardashian herself repeated that claim several times, despite Apple issuing a statement saying ""there were absolutely no issues with the App Store.""
At the same time, West criticized Nike, the only sportswear firm to have an official partnership with Apple, but he has long kept up this his praise of Steve Jobs. Speaking to Vogue magazine, he said in 2015 that: ""One of my dreams was to be the head creative director of the Gap. I'd like to be the Steve Jobs of the Gap When I say Steve Jobs of the Gap, as I talk to the people at the Gap right now, I'm not talking about a capsule. I'm talking about full Hedi Slimane creative control of the Gap is what I would like to do.""
Slimane is a photographer and fashion designer who at the time of that interview was creative director for Yves Saint Laurent."
Apple Insider,Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee reveals 'Solid' plan for users to take control of personal data,10/01/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/01/web-inventor-tim-berners-lee-reveals-solid-plan-for-users-to-take-control-of-personal-data,"Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, hopes to hand back control of personal data to individuals, with the launch of an open-source platform called Solid to control where data is stored and what entities have access to the information. 
Announced via a blog post on Saturday, Solid is described as an ""open-source project to restore the power and agency of individuals on the web."" Developed by Berners-Lee and people at MIT, Solid is effectively a single management location for a person's data, one which will provide the ability to dictate how and where the data is stored, which people and organizations can access specific elements, and how it is shared. 
The move to develop Solid was prompted by the trend for companies to acquire as much data about their users as possible, followed by mining the data and using it to market products and services to users. The wholesale acquisition and datamining has been a cause for concern for privacy activists, who have previously warned of the data's potential misuse. 
The most prominent case of misuse in recent times was the Cambridge Analytica scandal, where the data of Facebook users was acquired by the political analysis firm and used by political parties to influence events, allegedly including the 2016 U.S. presidential election. 
""Solid changes the current model where users have to hand over personal data to digital giants in exchange for perceived value,"" writes Berners-Lee. ""As we've all discovered, this hasn't been in our best interests. Solid is how we evolve the web in order to restore balance - by giving every one of us complete control over data, personal or not, in a revolutionary way."" 
For end users, their data is stored in one or more Solid personal online data stores, or PODs, which can be stored in the location of a user's choice, including online storage services or a home server. The data are said to be transferrable between locations at any time, without any interruption of service. 
The user can store practically any data they want in the POD, including photographs, videos, and fitness tracker data. The data can then be shared with apps and services of the user's choosing, as well as other people. 
As the data is also stored in a POD under the user's control, and not by other companies, there is no need to synchronize data if it is shared with multiple apps, as the same data source is used across the board. 
The POD is also being touted as a method of authentication, along the lines as logging in with a Facebook account to another services' website. The ownership of a POD will apparently provide third-parties with enough proof that the user is who they say they are. 
Berners-Lee is taking time off from his role at MIT to work on a start-up connected to Solid. Inrupt is a startup that intends to provide the infrastructure for the open-source Solid to function, as well as aiding apps in using Solid, and is also providing users with Solid PODs. 
As part of this work, Berners-Lee will be traveling the world for the next few months, educating developers about both Solid and Inrupt, reports Fast Company. He will also spend time this fall attempting to raise venture funding to grow the team, though it is unclear how successful this will be as the project aims to oppose the data collection activities of major tech companies like Facebook and Google.
It is also unclear how much this would impact Apple, as its own data policies shy away from the practices of other tech giants, in that minimal data is uploaded to its servers and processing is performed as much as possible on the user's end. An often-heard refrain from Apple is ""The customer is not our product,"" in that the company does not collect then use data for advertising purposes, instead aiming for a more transparent approach. 
In AppleInsider's brief testing of the Inrupt Solid POD, it appears the service is not ready for public usage, and is in a state more suited towards app developers. While the account creation is straightforward, and a public page can be created, it is difficult for the average user to make changes to their profile page. Meanwhile the profile page itself has the appearance of being editable by others, though this action is blocked when the changes are submitted. 
While it is possible to sign up for a free Solid POD from Inrupt right now, the main reason for the average user to do so is to secure their selected username before it becomes a more heavily used service. After apps and services start to use Solid, it is likely the user experience will be overhauled at around the same time."
Apple Insider,"Google Maps for iPhone gains Apple Music controls, new commuting options",10/01/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/01/google-maps-for-iphone-gains-apple-music-controls-new-commuting-options,"Google on Monday revealed a major update of Google Maps rolling out to iOS and Android this week, including a new Commute tab and support for music service  control without switching apps.
Users will soon be able to control Spotify, Apple Music, and Google Play Music, including podcasts, Google said. Typically however drivers will only be able to play, pause, or skip tracks — browsing content such as playlists will be limited to Spotify subscribers on Android.
Similar integration is already in another Google app, Waze.
The Commute tab will incorporate live traffic and transit data, such as real-time display of bus and train locations in 80 regions. People in Sydney, Australia will even be able to find out how full the next ride is so they don't try to rush for a full carriage.
Other features include forecasts based on traffic and accidents, and alternate routes as backup. Only Android users will get mid-route notifications about disruptions, but everyone will be able to see the complete details of ""mixed-mode"" trips —i.e. driving traffic, train departures, and walking times.
The free iPhone and iPad app should be updated sometime this week. 
Google recently updated both Waze and Google Maps to take advantage of third-party CarPlay navigation introduced with iOS 12. Drivers have sometimes complained about being limited to Apple Maps, which while regularly improving still lacks the options and accuracy offered by Google. It's not yet clear if Google Maps' CarPlay interface will get music support."
Apple Insider,"Net neutrality law enacted in California, US Justice Department promptly sues",10/01/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/01/net-neutrality-law-enacted-in-california-us-justice-department-promptly-sues,"The U.S. Justice Department is launching a lawsuit against the state of California over newly-signed net neutrality regulations, which could impact both internet service providers and their customers.
The Justice Department is seeking a preliminary injunction against the regulations, which will otherwise take effect on Jan. 1, according to Reuters. The federal government is arguing that ISPs ""cannot realistically comply with one set of standards in this area for California and another for the rest of the nation — especially when internet communications frequently cross multiple jurisdictions.""
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions elaborated on the point, holding that only states can regulate interstate commerce.
""Once again the California legislature has enacted an extreme and illegal state law attempting to frustrate federal policy,"" Sessions said in a prepared statement, referring to earlier clashes between the state and the federal government over issues like immigration.
The Federal Communications Commission voted 3 to 2 in December to undo Obama-era net neutrality protections, despite widescale public opposition — including companies like Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, and Reddit — as well as accusations that many anti-neutrality comments were faked. The effort to reverse neutrality was championed by Republican FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, along with ISPs like Verizon.
Pai has suggested that net neutrality harms consumers, for instance by barring data cap exemptions for streaming services like Spotify, YouTube, or Apple Music. People and companies in favor of the protections, though, have complained that favoring certain services can make it harder for new businesses to break into the market, and that selective throttling and paid prioritization could create a limited and/or unjust internet.
Apple has special interest in net neutrality, since the company's fortunes are increasingly dependent on services like iCloud, iTunes, Apple Music, and the App Store. The company is also planning to premiere high-budget TV shows in 2019, which will depend on unfettered internet connections to be watchable."
Apple Insider,Apple brings 'Everyone Can Create' curriculum to everybody in the Apple Books store,10/01/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/01/apple-brings-everyone-can-create-curriculum-to-everybody-in-the-apple-books-store,"Apple has widened availability of the Everyone Can Create curriculum, and has now posted the materials on the Apple Books marketplace not just for teachers, but for those wanting to learn from the materials as well.
Everyone Can Create includes four new project guides for drawing, music, video and photos now available for free in Apple Books. Each guide provides a series of projects that build skills progressively, helping students gain not just basic skills, but advanced vocabulary and techniques in each medium. A new teacher guide provides 300 lesson ideas across media, projects, and subjects.The program includes various resources and guides, with the aim of helping teachers integrate elements like music, drawing, photography, and filmmaking. These cover a range of subjects —such as math, history, and science —with the idea of getting students to use an iPad in creative ways to learn about topics like fractals.
Developed in collaboration with educators and creative professionals, Everyone Can Create includes teacher and student guides, lessons, ideas and examples to help teachers bring creativity and new communication skills into their existing subjects like English, math, science and history. For example, students can use the built-in camera in iPad to learn about fractals or they can use Apple Pencil and apps like Tayasui Sketches to learn about symmetry.
The curriculum is similar in concept to Everyone Can Code, Apple's effort to spread Swift programming in schools worldwide. Apple Stores are using Everyone Can Create in Today at Apple Teacher Tuesday sessions. Apple's 504 stores in 24 countries have already taught over 5,000 hands-on Teacher Tuesday sessions on topics including coding and app design, video and music creation, and creative visual presentations.
""Creativity sparks a deeper level of engagement in students, and we're excited to help teachers bring out that creativity in the classroom,"" said Apple's senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing Philip Schiller when the program was announced. ""When you combine the power of iPad, the creativity of Apple Pencil, over a million iPad apps in the App Store, the rich curriculum in Everyone Can Code and Everyone Can Create, and unique Classroom and Schoolwork apps that support students and help schools manage technology in the classroom, we believe we can amplify learning and creativity in a way that only Apple can.""
The Everyone Can Create program was launched at Apple's education-focused even that saw the debut of the sixth-generation iPad, new software for schools, such as a planned iWork update for iOS with Apple Pencil support and the ability to build digital books in Pages."
Apple Insider,"Apple may be fighting saturated smartphone market in US, but iPad still has room for growth",10/01/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/01/apple-may-be-fighting-saturated-smartphone-market-in-us-but-ipad-still-has-room-for-growth,"Apple's efforts to continue growing its market share in the United States may be facing resistance from the market itself, as Pew research data indicates high levels of saturation for smartphones and cellphones, leaving few relatively few brand new customers to acquire. 
The data, released by the Pew Research Center on Saturday, suggests that the overall use of Internet-connected devices and related services has remained in approximately the same state as was found in 2016. While previous surveys showed general growth trends across all monitored segments, the differences between 2016 and 2018's results are relatively minimal. 
Approximately 95 percent of U.S. Adults in 2018 own and use cellphones, while 77 percent claim to own or use smartphones. The recorded results are notably the same values as found in 2016, just as discovered for social media's usage by 69 percent of adults. 
Of elements that have changed, Internet use has grown from 88 to 89 percent, tablet usage has increased from 51 percent to 53 percent, and desktop or notebook computer usage has dropped from 78 percent to 73 percent. 
""A contributing factor behind this slowing growth is that parts of the population have reached near-saturation levels of adoption of some technologies,"" writes Pew's Paul Hitlin. ""Put simply, in some instances there just aren't many non-users left."" 
Drilling down into specific groups, approximately 91 percent of people aged 18 to 49 currently own or use a smartphone, with 99 percent using some form of cellular communication, with college graduates measured at 91 percent and 97 percent respectively for each area. Smartphone penetration is also up to 93 percent for households with an income of $75,000 or more, with 98 percent owning or using a cellphone. 
For tablet ownership and usage, like for the iPad, the figures again suggest the educated and the affluent to be the biggest users. While 55 percent of adults aged 18 to 49 say they own or use a tablet, higher than the 53 percent for all surveyed, the number grows to 66 percent for college graduates, and 72 percent for those with a $75,000 minimum household income. 
With figures generally below 60 percent, the data suggests the iPad isn't encumbered by a saturation problem, and has a fair way to go before wide ownership and usage of tablets becomes a problem for sales. 
While the saturation of the highly competitive U.S. market may be causing problems for increasing iPhone shipments for Apple, the company has already worked to continue the growth in other areas. Apple continues to make headway in growing and emerging markets that are far from saturation, such as China and India, meanwhile the higher average selling price created by the introduction of last year's iPhone X and this year's iPhone XS models will help increase iPhone-derived revenue. 
In the United States specifically, Apple continues to enjoy a healthy lead over other smartphone producers, with domestic sales in the March quarter said to have been up 16 percent year-on-year in a May report. Furthermore, the same report revealed Apple had six of the 10 most popular smartphone models sold in the U.S in the first quarter, with the top five of the list made up of variants of the iPhone X and iPhone 8."
Apple Insider,FBI makes suspect unlock iPhone X in first confirmed instance of forced Face ID,09/30/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/09/30/fbi-makes-suspect-unlock-iphone-x-in-first-confirmed-instance-of-forced-face-id,"The FBI recently ordered a suspect to unlock his iPhone X via Face ID, in the first known example of police doing so anywhere in the world. 
The incident occurred on Aug. 10, when the FBI searched the house of Grant Michalski in Columbus, Ohio during a child abuse investigation, Forbes reported on Sunday, citing court documents. Special agent David Knight ordered Michalski to face the iPhone, triggering Face ID.
Michalski was ultimately charged with receiving and possessing child pornography. The search uncovered related Kik conversations, including a chat with someone who was really an undercover officer.
Only some data was obtained from the iPhone however as the FBI didn't have Michalski's passcode, which put up roadblocks for forensic tools after the device had been locked for more than an hour. Knight noted he wasn't able to document things like app use or deleted files, but added that he'd discovered that the Columbus Police Department and the Ohio Bureau of Investigation have ""technological devices that are capable of obtaining forensic extractions from locked iPhones without the passcode,"" presumably referring to hardware offered by Cellebrite and/or Grayshift.
A lawyer for Michalski, Steven Nolder, told Forbes that the FBI turned to Cellebrite, but has so far failed to get anything useful. He also commented that police are now using boilerplate language in warrants to cover Face ID.
Mandatory Touch ID unlocks have been happening for years, even being used on corpses. Though controversial the practice is currently legal, and sometimes claimed to be necessary by U.S. law enforcement since suspects can't be forced to turn over their passcodes. Conventional forensic tools are often defeated by the full-disk encryption and other security measures in iOS.
Cellebrite and Grayshift recently scored major contracts with the U.S. Secret Service, valued at $780,000 and $484,000, respectively. Grayshift also picked up a $384,000 deal with Immigration Customs Enforcement."
Apple Insider,Comparing Apple's gold finishes on the Series 2 versus Series 4 Apple Watch,09/30/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/09/30/comparing-apples-gold-finishes-on-the-series-2-versus-series-4-apple-watch,"For the fourth edition of the Apple Watch, Apple included a gold stainless steel model. To give you the best idea of the finishes, we are comparing the stainless steel gold Apple Watch Series 4, the aluminum gold Apple Watch Series 4, and the aluminum rose gold Series 2 Apple Watch.
As a bit of history, Apple has had gold variants of the Apple Watch for some time —including the original $10,000 and up gold Apple Watch Edition. More recently, there was the rose gold Series 2, and the aluminum gold Series 3. For the Series 4, a stainless steel joins the aluminum.
Our hands-on video clearly gives you the best look of the trio of finishes. There are a few things of note.
In our time testing them, we found the stainless steel to be the better finish that will appeal to the most users. The matte aluminum has a bit more of a yellow hue, where the more reflective stainless leans a tad towards copper/brass.
Recently, we took a look at the gold Milanese loop band that Apple also released, but we wanted to take a look at how that band looks on the aluminum, instead of the stainless as was featured in our review.
As you can see, the Milanese loop features polished stainless steel lugs, which doesn't perfectly match the matte aluminum. Luckily, from the front, it has that matte finish we talked about earlier, and we feel that it blends in better. The band doesn't match as seamlessly as it does on the stainless, but it will only be particularly noticeable on close inspection.
We also compared the aluminum and stainless vs the discontinued rose gold.
All three versions of gold have their merits, but we think opting for gold over rose gold was the right move overall, and the stainless is particularly stunning to see.
Still debating on the latest Apple Watch? Check out our review of the new Series 4. Not sure if you want to go with aluminum or gold? AppleInsider's handy guide walks you through the differences and helps you decide.Where to buy
Apple authorized resellers B&H Photo and Abt.com are currently accepting orders for the Apple Watch Series 4.

Apple Insider,"Crime blotter: California arrests, a Monster firing, and bulk thefts of new iPhones",09/30/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/09/30/crime-blotter-california-arrests-a-monster-firing-and-bulk-thefts-of-new-iphones,"A father goes after his ex-wife in court after she took their daughter's iPhone, Find My iPhone finds a stolen iPad, and other news from the world of Apple-related crime. 
The latest in an occasional AppleInsider series, on the latest in Apple crime. Charges brought against 17 in California Apple Store thefts 
California's state attorney general has brought charges for conspiracy to commit grand theft against 17 individuals in the thefts of Apple Stores around the state that have taken place throughout the year. Seven people were arrested, with warrants issued for the other ten, in the thefts that cost the stores more than $1 million in lost merchandise. 
The investigation was conducted by the San Luis Obispo Police Department and the Oakland Police Department, along with the state Department of Justice eCrime Unit and 19 different counties. Two wanted for Long Island Apple Store theft 
On the opposite coast from most recent Apple Store thefts, two men are wanted for taking items from an Apple Store in Huntington Station, N.Y. But instead of iPhones or iPads, those thieves are accused of taking four sets of Beats headphones, two Apple Pencils and two Magic Mouse devices, Patch reported. Monster fires COO, alleging death threats 
Monster Products, the cable and headphone maker that was the original manufacturing partner for Beats headphones, has been in often-contentious litigation with Apple since 2015, stemming from the earlier Beats/Monster breakup. Now, the company has suffered another falling out. Monster announced Sept. 25 that it has removed its chief operating officer, Fereidoun ""Fred"" Khalilian, and also obtained a restraining order against him. 
At a press conference the New York tech show CE Week in June, founder and CEO Noel Lee (known as the ""Head Monster"") appeared with Khalilian to announce a cryptocurrency play called ""Monster Money,"" which would represent the long privately-held company's first time accepting outside money in its 40-year history. 
But something apparently went awry, as Monster now alleges Khalilian attempted a hostile takeover of the company, and that the restraining order and police report were necessary ""for the protection of numerous employees of Monster against threats of mutilation, death, and threats to family."" 
Monster's statement, in a rarity for corporate press releases, goes on to provide more than a dozen links to news stories and documents detailing Khalilian's past alleged misdeeds, which reportedly include various scams as well as multiple sexual assault accusations that stem from a period when he co-owned a Miami nightclub with Paris Hilton. In addition Khalilian, due to a 2011 FTC settlement, is permanently banned from the telemarketing industry. Charges dismissed against mother who took daughter's iPhone 
A routine parenting dispute in which a mother punished her daughter by taking away her iPhone became a matter for the courts this month, when the woman's ex-husband claimed the device belonged to him. According to WOOD TV, the former husband claimed that he owned the iPhone, and that his ex had committed a crime by taking it away. 
The case, however, was dismissed after prosecutors determined that the daughter was, in fact, the phone's rightful owner. Chilean family in Miami has 18 iPhones stolen 
A family from Chile that visited Miami to get iPhones had 18 XS Max models — valued at around $18,000 — stolen from their rental car last week. According to the Miami Herald, the family had planned to bring the phones back to Chile and ""hand them out to family members and friends."" But the car was broken into while they visited a coffee shop. 
""Imagine buying a just released iPhone and having it stolen. These people bought 18, stopped for coffee, left the phones in the car, and moments later all were stolen,"" Miami Beach police spokesman Ernesto Rodriguez said on Twitter, attaching video of a TV news report on the theft. 55 iPhones taken in Michigan 
In another bulk theft of 2018 iPhone models, 55 iPhones were stolen from an SUV at a mall in Troy, Mich. According to Click on Detroit, a man had spent $60,000 to buy 55 new iPhones with the intent of re-selling them. 
But, while he was elsewhere in the mall, someone broke the car window and took the merchandise. iPhone stolen from government building in Michigan 
A 56-year-old man had his iPhone stolen from the ordinance department counter at City Hall in Dearborn Heights, Mich. According to the Press and Guide, the man briefly stepped away from the counter and when he returned the iPhone was gone. 
After the owner called the phone, a man answered and ""allegedly shouted profanities before hanging up."" Teenager admits to stealing iPhones from Staten Island Apple Store 
A teenager is headed to jail after he admitted to stealing six iPhones — worth $4,400 — from an Apple Store on Staten Island on the day after Christmas last year. According to SI Live, the now-18-year-old pled guilty to third-degree grand larceny, and will be sentenced next month to a year in jail. Security guard arrested for taking iPhones 
In another theft from a government building, a security guard at the Palm Beach County Government Center in West Palm Beach, Fla., has been arrested for stealing two iPhones, one of was in a case that also included $160 in cash, a drivers license and two debit cards. 
According to My Palm Beach Post, the guard was caught on security video disposing of the license and cards, although he told deputies he had ""gone upstairs to retrieve pants from a break room.""Find My iPhone discovers stolen iPad 
A nursing assistant received a sentence of two years' probation after he was found to have stolen an iPad from a patient at the assisted living facility where he worked. According to KSL, a Find My iPhone discovered not only that the iPad was in the area where the assistant lived, but that its device had been charged to the assistant's own first name. He pled guilty to theft, after earlier being charged with exploitation of a vulnerable adult. 23 iPhones taken from AT&T store   
A total of 23 iPhones, valued at a total of more than $20,000, were stolen from a single AT&T store in Ohio over a three-week period, the Dayton Daily News reported. An employee is suspected to be the culprit. iPad taken from stroller at a wedding 
A woman's iPad was stolen from the lower component of a baby stroller, while the baby's mother was attending a wedding. According to the Bothel Reporter, the case has been closed, because ""there were no security cameras observing the stroller at the time of the theft and there was no other useful information to be found.""Tracking device catches woman who took iPhone
An Ohio woman was caught taking an iPhone from an area Walmart due to a GPS tracker on the device's box. According to Cleveland.com, police followed the signal and then confronted the woman at a gas station. The woman claimed the device had ""accidentally fallen into her bag and that she had just discovered it was there and intended to return it.""

Apple Insider,New iPhone XS owners should get these essential apps from the App Store,09/29/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/09/29/new-iphone-xs-owners-should-get-these-essential-apps-from-the-app-store,"Everybody's different but there are some tools that help us all. Apple makes plenty of them and is getting better at including most on the phone but there are more. AppleInsider picks the apps that should be on your new iPhone.
This has the word legal written all over it. For years, Apple made certain key iPhone apps yet didn't install them. You had to know they existed and then deliberately go download them yourself. It's probably a legacy of when some of these apps were paid purchases and now they're free, but whatever the reason, it was a pain.
Things are much better since the iPhone 6 and in particular phones with greater storage capacity. Starting with the 64GB version of the 6, Apple installed the iWork apps on larger iPhones. Today it officially installs them on everything.
That's officially, though. In practice you may not notice if you're an existing iPhone user. Unless you choose to setup your shiny iPhone XR, XS or XS Max as a new phone, each time you move to a new one you bring along your previous apps. 
And it's not as if the days of Apple choosing to hide great apps is over: just try looking for the Siri Shortcuts app on your new phone.
Then alongside the Apple-made apps, there are some essential apps —or categories of app —to get every iPhone ready for serious use. About that Shortcuts app
It's a mystery why Apple would tout this app as one of the key new features of iOS 12 and then not give it to you. Go get it yourself from here. 
To be fair, Shortcuts is a slightly schizophrenic feature for iOS 12 in that it's deeply embedded into Siri whether you have this app or not. It's just that without it, you're severely limited as to what you can create a shortcut to do.
Specifically, you're limited to what Siri believes would be useful and then offers to you. Many apps include features to help setup Siri Shortcuts but the sole way to create one from scratch is via this Apple app that you haven't got.
You'll take a time to really grasp all Shortcuts can do for you: first you have to notice something you do repeatedly and that takes several steps. Then you need to see how you can tell Shortcuts those steps. 
If you've used Workflow on iOS or something like Automator on Mac then this will be familiar. If you haven't, you'll just have to experiment. Open the Shortcuts app and tap on Gallery at bottom right. This will show you what uses other people have found for the feature —and how they did it.Hidden or ignored
If that iPhone XR, XS or XS Max is your very first iPhone then you're lucky in so many ways. One of them, though, is that you definitely escape an issue that can affect those of us who move from iPhone to iPhone. If you always choose Restore from Backup then you won't have the iWork apps installed on your phone.
These are the word processor Pages, the spreadsheet Numbers and the presentation software Keynote
Ironically, when you do have these apps you tend to ignore them specifically because they're pre-installed. There is a perception that Pages, for instance, is inferior to Microsoft Word. That's partly because it genuinely isn't as powerful and partly because Apple hides features to avoid distractions. Yet it's also because it's provided free just like the Weather and Stocks apps.
You can see why Apple might have left the iWork apps off back when it used to sell iPhones with just 8GB of storage space, which it did until the iPhone 6 in 2014. Then, too, you could easily argue that it wasn't practical to run Pages, Numbers or Keynote on an iPhone with a small screen.
We did, though, and especially with an external keyboard we did it often. Now that we have the iPhone X range's size and quality of display, however, you can genuinely do all the work you used to do on a laptop. Get them while you can
If you haven't got them, download all three the next time you're on Wi-Fi. These are the apps that will help you get serious work done when you find yourself stuck without a MacBook.
Only, you must get them when you're on Wi-Fi. Numbers, for instance, is currently 476.7MB which is astonishingly small for a spreadsheet —but it's more than Apple will let you download over cellular. The ceiling for that is 150MB so you can't download Pages (511MB) or Keynote (691MB) either.Apple's oddities
You could download Apple's Music Memos app which comes in at just 102.2MB. It's not an essential for everyone: this is an app that lets you quickly take down ideas for songs or other music by recording yourself humming or playing an instrument.
However, it's also an app that is like the iWork ones: made by Apple specifically for iPhones and free. It's more like Siri Shortcuts, though: it is still not installed with iOS. 
If you are a musician then also check that GarageBand has been installed on your iPhone: if it isn't there, you can get it now. Note that it's 1.7GB, though. 
That is substantial and if you also had to grab iMovie you'd need another 707.1MB. Get iMovie, GarageBand, Music Memos plus the iWork trio and you're looking at 4.2GB.
If you have them but just never launch any of them, you could save yourself some room on your iPhone. It's just that as 4.2GB goes, these are very productive apps.
They're also ones that typically provide most people with most things they need to do to get working. You can write any document you need in Pages, and export it to Word later it you want. You can do any spreadsheet work and export to Excel, 
You can do any presentation work in Keynote and then later regret exporting it to PowerPoint when you see how bad Microsoft's software is.
If it's about getting maximum use for your iPhone then we'd want Siri Shortcuts installed and make the Stocks app be one you have to download.Maximum use
There are apps that will show off what your iPhone can do and there are ones that you will simply relish using. However, there are two more that you must look at: two that we would see baked into iPhones if we possibly could.
It's really two categories of app and the first is a password manager. We didn't say these were exciting. What we said was that you must look at them and we mean you must pick one and install it. 
A password manager is a secure app that creates strong passwords for you and remembers them, too. Increasingly Safari is doing this but a password manager app can also hold your bank details, your credit card ones and all your app login or licence details.
Security is one great thing but the sheer speed and convenience of access to your private details is another. Password managers make logging into a site or paying for something with your credit card be startlingly fast.
It's still a couple of steps but your new iPhone comes with iOS 12 which has added a feature called AutoFill to help you use password managers more readily. 
The four main password managers for iOS are 1Password, LastPass, Dashlane and Keeper.Have iPhone, will travel 
You are not going to confine your iPhone to your home or office. It is a tool you'll carry with you everywhere and, what's more, that you'll use everywhere too. With having that great technology at your display, though, comes an issue of security.
That airport Wi-Fi network you just joined could belong to the airline. However, it could belong to the suspicious person who's been sitting in Departures for a long time. Before you do anything on your phone that sends sensitive information like logins and passwords out across Wi-Fi, get a VPN.
It stands for Virtual Private Network but it's a case where knowing what the words are doesn't explain what it does. VPNs often get described instead as tunnels: they connect you from your iPhone to the site or service you want to use and they do it in such a way that nobody else can see.
Really, they encrypt all the data you're sending or receiving over the internet. So you could be using that fake airport Wi-Fi to check your online banking and you'd still be safe. 
A byproduct of this security is that VPNs also mask where you are. To the site or service you're using, you're logging in from one of the VPN company's servers and that could be anywhere across the world.
That means you can escape geographic restrictions. Say you're a US Hulu subscriber just waiting for the new series of Veronica Mars but you're currently visiting the UK on an extended holiday. You're paying Hulu so you should be able to watch it, but because you're outside your home region, it won't work.
Unless you use a VPN. 
It's not guaranteed: Netflix now tries to identify and block traffic coming in from a VPN but then this is a byproduct of the tunnelling technology, it's not the main aim.
There are dozens of VPN services for iOS and Mac. Try NordVPN which provides this service for $3.99 per month or TunnelBear which is free for light use with in-app purchases starting at $6.99.The main aim
You should be able to get your iPhone set up and letting you do serious work on it right from the start. That means being secure and having the best apps available.
Seriously, we wonder about why Siri Shortcuts isn't pre-installed. Still, we're relieved to see that Apple's main iWork apps now usually are.Keep up with AppleInsider by downloading the AppleInsider app for iOS, and follow us on YouTube, Twitter @appleinsider and Facebook for live, late-breaking coverage.

Apple Insider,Apple's iOS 12 update is causing sporadic issues with iPhone charging,09/29/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/09/29/apples-ios-12-update-is-causing-sporadic-issues-with-iphone-charging,"Multiple reports are suggesting that iOS 12 may have a bug, causing periodic and random issues with devices not charging when plugged in to a power source, or placed on a wireless charging pad without user interaction.
At Apple's discussion board, there are currently 108 users commenting on a potential problem with either the iPhone XS or iOS 12. The fault occurs when the user connects a Lightning cable to the charge port using a common wall charger, or place the device on a Qi charging pad.
Most of the time, the iPhone functions as expected, and immediately begins charging the phone. 
However, on occasion, users plugging the phone will neither get a charge symbol, nor the noise that the device plays when it begins charging. Some users were able to get the phone to begin to charge by plugging it in, waiting between 10 and 15 seconds, and waking the phone —but not necessarily unlocking it.
""If i haven't interacted with the phone for some time, it becomes unresponsive to a charger being plugged in,"" said one user. ""But if I unplug then lift it and start using it, it will recognize the charger.""UnboxTherapy tested a variety of iPhone XS units in studio and found they could repeat the problem. They tested nine separate iPhone XS and XS Max phones and were able to demonstrate the issue a handful of times. However, AppleInsider has not yet gotten the issue to manifest with an iPhone XS Max, iPhone X, or iPhone 8 Plus running iOS 12 connected to USB-A to Lightning or USB-C to Lightning plugged into either a computer, a wall adapter, or any one of a variety of Qi charging pads.
However, an iPhone 7 and 12.9-inch first-generation iPad Pro have both manifested the problem once each during some testing on Saturday evening.
The issue may be related to USB restricted mode, a feature that Apple developed to help secure data on the phone against devices that try and download a phone's data for law enforcement or nefarious purposes. USB restricted mode shouldn't be interfering with a simple wall charger, but the interaction that users are noticing, lifting the phone in order to get it to charge after it's been left idle, seems related to the need to unlock a device to get it to connect to a peripheral through Lightning.
The issue may also be manifesting elsewhere. Belkin has confirmed that its original PowerHouse and Valet charging docks are incompatible with the iPhone XS family. Users attempting to use those devices are finding that the iPhone simply will not charge when placed on the device. Belkin has noted on the product page that the devices aren't compatible with the iPhone XS family, or the forthcoming iPhone XR —but has not elaborated as to why.AppleInsider has reached out to Apple for comment on the matter."
Apple Insider,These are the top 7 features of the new iPhone XS & iPhone XS Max,09/29/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/09/29/these-are-the-top-7-features-of-the-new-iphone-xs-iphone-xs-max,"There are lots of new features baked into Apple's latest handsets. Instead of outlining everything new, we've picked out our favorite new features that have made the biggest difference day-to-day using Apple's latest phones.
Unlike in years past, both the smaller and plus-sized iPhones have feature parity. Everything found one is found in the other, minus the larger display and slightly prolonged battery life.
So let's dig in to our favorite new features.Gold finish
We are a bit divided on the traditional yellow-gold, but Apple's implementation has won us over. It is a subtler hue of gold that looks fantastic, with an off-white glass panel on the back.
Even better, it perfectly matches the new stainless steel gold Apple Watch Series 4.6.5-inch display
This year marks the largest display ever included on an iPhone, with the iPhone XS Max coming in at 6.5-inches. Even though the phone is very nearly the same physical size as any of the older plus-devices ranging back to the iPhone 6 Plus, the display is now completely edge-to-edge.
Compared to the 8 Plus and before, the frame is made out of glossy stainless steel instead of aluminum, which has a bit more grip.Live wallpapers
There are three new Live wallpapers included on the XS and XS Max. You may be familiar with them if you've seen any of Apple's recent advertisements.
Each of the three has a slightly different hue. While they look like planets, they are instead mixes of vivid moving swirls of paint.Faster wireless charging
Instead of upping the wattage supported by wireless charging, Apple has improved the tech they already have implemented.
The iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max have tighter coils internally that will support quicker and more efficient wireless charging on existing 7.5W chargers. Best yet, you don't need to upgrade the Qi charger you already have to take advantage of it.Improved cameras
We aren't going to delve into everything new with the latest cameras here, so we will just touch on our favorite enhancements.
First, thanks to the new larger pixels with increased depth, there is better low light performance. Second, thanks to the new ISP and Neural Engine, color representation is more accurate, Portrait Mode locks on quicker and looks better than ever.
The depth can also be adjusted in the photos, increasing and decreasing the amount of background blur.4GB RAM
Up from the 3GB of RAM found in that iPhone X and XR, the iPhone XS and XS Max both have 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM. This is helpful throughout the OS, but particularly when there are lots of web pages open or you constantly jump between active apps.Gigabit-class LTE
This feature will entirely depend on your location and carrier, but we noticed significant improvements to our cellular performance.
On the exterior, two new antenna bands —one on the top and one on the bottom —help support this new gigabit-class LTE with 4x4 MIMO. These new devices also support T-Mobile's Band 71 spectrum which will come into play for users in rural areas.More to love
These are just our top features. This doesn't touch on the new speakers, faster A12 Bionic processor, more robust water resistance, stereo recording in video, and the other improvements found on the iPhone XS and XS Max.

Apple Insider,Photo smackdown: iPhone XS Max versus Samsung's Galaxy Note 9,09/29/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/09/29/photo-smackdown-iphone-xs-max-versus-samsungs-galaxy-note-9,"Among everything new with the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, the camera saw the most love from Apple, with changes like a new larger sensor on the wide end, a brand new depth control feature which works incredibly well now that portrait blur is more accurate and a new Smart HDR feature.
The Samsung Galaxy Note 9's camera has similar 12MP sensors behind the telephoto and wide lenses. It also has a live focus feature that simulates background blur, which also allows you to adjust the blur after you snap a photo. 
We went out to Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, and snapped a bunch of photos so we could see how Apple's new iPhone XS Max performs against the Note 9.Comparing High Dynamic Range (HDR)
In this first portrait mode shot, you can see how much better the dynamic range is on the iPhone XS Max. The t-shirt in the Note 9's image is blown out, whereas the XS Max's image is completely balanced. Not only that, but the darkest areas in the shot are brighter on the iPhone.
Here, the sky on the Note 9 is overexposed, and there's a huge loss in color. If you take a close look at the buildings in the background, they're blown out as well. However, the Note 9 was able to keep the subject looking brighter and better exposed. We noticed much more saturation on the Note 9's image as well, which is a personal preference, but we prefer the more natural look.
Here's where the story changes. When shooting against the sun, the Note 9 does a much better job at dynamic range. The highlights look the same, but the Note 9 is able to keep the darkest areas of the scene looking brighter. There's less lens flare on the Note 9 as well.
Now here's a photo of the same scene except using portrait mode. The sunspot on the Note 9 is larger, but it does much better keeping the subject exposed properly. There's a massive flare on the iPhone XS Max's image again. 
In this shot, the Note 9 has noticeably better dynamic range inside the parking garage. Comparing Portrait & Live Focus Mode Photos
In this portrait mode shot, you'll notice that the XS Max has more blur in the background. You'll also notice that the shirt in the Note 9's image is a bit blown out. One thing we like about the XS Max's image is that it's more balanced, with a background that is exposed brighter.
The iPhone XS & XS Max have a new depth control feature, and there's a much wider range of blur adjustment compared to the Note 9. The iPhones can go from a depth setting of F16, all the way to F1.4. The Note 9 can only go from 0-7.
The background on the Note 9's Live Focus photos can't get nearly as blurry as they can on the iPhone XS Max, and we think a lot of people would like to have that kind of freedom.
When shooting plants, the Note 9 does a much better job. In this photo, the white balance is more accurate and the image looks more pleasing. The XS Max struggles with blur edging, whereas the Note 9 does just fine.
In this photo of a flower, the XS Max actually blurs out the whole stem. The Note 9 is able to detect the stem and keep it in the foreground. This is a huge advantage for the Note.
Comparing front-facing portrait modes, the Note 9 is looking a bit soft. There's much more detail in the face with the XS Max. The background also looks brighter and more balanced on the iPhone. 
Another perk on the XS Max is that you can adjust the blur on the front-facing portrait shots as well. The Note 9 isn't able to do this. Because of this, the XS Max is able to get portrait photos with incredibly high levels of blur, and it actually turns out quite nice.
Comparing Portrait mode photos of objects, the iPhone XS Max is getting much better dynamic range. Both phones struggle with blur edging, but the Note 9 is a little bit better.
In this photo with a small crease on the inside of two poles, the iPhone XS Max completely fails to detect that it needs to blur the inside of the object. The Note 9 does an almost perfect job at it. However, the dynamic range on the Note 9 is quite bad. Photo Detail Comparison
Now let's compare detail without using Portrait or Live focus modes.
In this shot of a flower, both photos look very detailed, but it seems that the Note 9 either has more contrast or it's more detailed compared to the XS Max. You'll have to decide for yourself which photo you think is better at color reproduction.
In this telephoto image of a tree, the Note 9 has more contrast and it has more detail as well.
Here's another comparison of detail. The XS Max has noticeably better dynamic range, and they seem similar in detail. The Note 9 has more contrast and it adds more saturation to the image.
Now comparing regular selfie photos, the difference in dynamic range is shocking. The sky on the Note 9's image is completely blown out. On the XS Max, you can see every single cloud, and the sky is actually blue. At the same time, the face is properly exposed and there's more detail as well.
Here's a wide image shot from the inside of a building. There's noticeably better dynamic range on the XS Max, and it's able to accurately reproduce the colors in the sky and background.Low Light Photo Comparison
Moving onto some low light photos, there's a couple of things you'll notice here. First of all, the dynamic range is slightly better on the iPhone, and the white balance is much more accurate. The biggest difference is that the Note 9 adds way too much softening to get rid of the noise. Just look at all of the detail in the pants that is lost on the Note 9. 
In this portrait & live focus mode comparison. The Note 9 fails to accurately detect the face and ends up blurring it, even after multiple attempts. Not only that, but the dynamic range is worlds better on the XS Max. 
We shot these images with extremely low light. The Note 9 has very impressive noise reduction, making the image look a lot more detailed. You can easily see more noise with the XS Max. However, the white balance is way off on the Note 9. The XS Max was about as accurate as you can get.
Now on the front-facing camera, the dynamic range differences were huge. The painting on the Note 9's image was completely blown out. With the iPhone XS Max, you can see every detail. The XS Max was better at white balance as well.
Now outside, towards the end of the night, both phones didn't that great of a job with dynamic range, but the iPhone XS Max did a little bit better. The white balance is much better on the iPhone as well, and the Note 9 added way too much saturation.
Finally, we have a low light scene with bokeh in the background to compare the portrait & live focus modes. The Note 9 had issues accurately detecting the face and it ended up putting a slight blur over it. The XS Max did a great job with blur edging. The Note 9 was already at the maximum amount of blur, while the XS Max was at the default F4.5 setting.
Now here's where it gets amazing on the iPhone XS Max. We set the depth to the maximum setting of F1.4, and the bokeh really starts to stand out. This shows just how much extra blur you can get on the iPhone XS Max, which we think has the potential to convince a lot of customers to go with the XS or XS Max over the Note 9.
If you compare the blur on the left and right sides of the iPhone's image, you'll see that they're directionally warped, based on where they're at in the frame. This is something that professional cameras do, and it's nice that Apple added this realistic touch. On the Note 9, the bokeh simply gets larger when you increase the blur, and that's about it.
Let us know what you thought about this comparison in the comments, and stay tuned for our iPhone XS Max versus Note 9 video quality comparison, where we'll be testing if Apple's claims of improved video quality are true. Deals on the iPhone XS Max and Galaxy Note 9

Apple Insider,How to keep notifications in iOS 12 under control with Instant Tuning,09/29/18,https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/09/29/how-to-keep-notifications-in-ios-12-under-control-with-instant-tuning,"Some iPhone and iPad apps abuse notifications, using them for glorified advertising or bombarding you with so much information that it becomes pointless. A new feature in iOS 12, ""Instant Tuning,"" makes it easier to keep notifications in line.
If you wanted to control notifications in iOS 11, you typically had to dive into the Notifications menu in the Settings app. You can still do that if you like, but iOS 12 makes it possible to cope with an app's notifications the moment one pops up.
To do this, use 3D Touch on a notification to open up a preview, then tap the ""..."" menu in the upper-right. Alternately you can swipe left on a notification and tap ""Manage.""
You'll then see two main options, ""Deliver Quietly"" and ""Turn Off."" The latter is pretty self-explanatory, but Deliver Quietly will allow an app's messages to appear in the Notification Center without triggering sounds, badges, banners, or even an appearance on your lockscreen. 
Be careful — if you know an app occasionally delivers important info, you may want to exert more granular control. For that there's a ""Settings"" button, which will jump straight to the full dashboard for an app's notifications.
If you've activated Deliver Quietly but changed your mind, simply go through Instant Tuning again and you'll find that the option has been replaced by ""Deliver Prominently."" Selecting that will restore things to normal."
